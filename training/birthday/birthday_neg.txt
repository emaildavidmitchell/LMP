In 1926, she established an independent portraiture studio in Paris, attracting clients from international avant-garde circles.

In the mid-1940s Abbott shifted her focus towards science photography and was later employed at MIT, where she invented devices and methods for photographing light, speed, magnetism, and gravity, that she used to produce images for textbooks and her own 1964 books Motion and Magnet.

Qasim Amin's first major foray into public writing was his rebuttal of the Duc d'Harcourt's 1893 attack on Egyptian society and culture.

Having begun his career as an assistant to Henry Moore, he made his name following a ground-breaking exhibition of his work at the Whitechapel Gallery, London in 1963, in which large, abstract, brightly-coloured steel sculptures were displayed standing directly on the ground.

His role in art education was of equal import; teaching at Saint Martin’s School of Art from 1953-81, he introduced a new approach, which questioned the boundaries of the medium and encouraged a new generation of British sculptors.

A visit to Greece also led to a series based on classical pediments in 1986, and in 1992 a piece entitled The Trojan War.

In the 1990s, Caro began using architectural elements in his sculpture, a concept he dubbed ‘sculptitecture,’ which allowed visitors to interact with his work.

 He initially produced figurative works in clay and plaster with rough, expressive surfaces such as ‘Woman in Pregnancy’ (1955); these began to gain public recognition from the mid-1950s in solo exhibitions at the Galleria del Naviglio, Milan (1956) and Gimpel Fils, London (1957), and were included in group shows at the ICA (1955) and at the Venice Biennale in 1958. 

 In 1959 he met the influential American critic Clement Greenberg, and subsequently travelled to the US for the first time where he met David Smith, Kenneth Noland and many other artists associated with Abstract Expressionism. 

 On his return, he began creating abstract sculptures in steel, which culminated in a large solo exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1963.

Impresario, critic, curator and founder-director of the Ballets Russes (1909-1929), Serge Diaghilev was a towering figure and pioneer of early twentieth-century modernism.

So closely was Diaghilev’s forceful, larger-than-life personality linked to the identity of the Ballets Russes that within months of his death in 1929 the company collapsed.

In 1890, after finishing his secondary studies, he set off on a grand tour of Europe with his cousin Dmitrii Filosofov.

In Vienna, he saw operas by Mozart, Rossini and Verdi, as well as his first ballet, Josef Bayer’s Die Puppenfee (1888).  

By 1896 he had published his first art criticism, and in 1897 he mounted an exhibition of over two hundred English and German watercolours at St. Petersburg’s Stieglitz Museum.  

In 1898, he curated another show, this one highlighting Russian and Finnish art.

Among other factors, the hostility aroused by this project, which Diaghilev envisioned as an artistically ambitious and costly one involving several of his World of Art colleagues, led to his dismissal from the Imperial Theatres in 1901.

Diaghilev also pitched ideas for music concerts and, most famously, began planning this first ballet project, an ambitious new production of Leo Delibes’ Sylvia (1876).

In 1963, he began studying acting in Munich.

The ten or so films that he made between 1969 and 1971 built directly upon his work in the Anti-Theatre, using static camera and self-consciously non-naturalistic dialogue; they clearly reflect the influences of Bertolt Brecht and Jean-Luc Godard. 

Starting around 1971, however, Fassbinder shifted toward the aesthetic that made him internationally famous: critical melodrama.

Ghatak’s career as a director contains only eight films and includes the famous trilogy that deals with lives of refugees: Meghe Dhaka Tara (Cloud Capped Star, 1960), Komal Gandhar (E-Flat, 1961), and Subarnarekha (The Golden Thread, 1965)

She later studied with Charles Newton (1816–1894) in the Department of Antiquities of the British Museum and began a career as a speaker on archaeology and classical art before her appointment to Newnham as a lecturer in 1898. 

Her frequent travels to Greece, as well as friendships and correspondences with classicists Gilbert Murray (1866–1957), F. M. Cornford (1874–1943) and other Cambridge Ritualists, prepared Harrison for her two most well-known books, Prolegomena To The Study Of Greek Religion (1903) and A Study Of The Social Origins Of Greek Religion (1912).

He is best remembered for his short story collection Arkhas Layaly (1954, The Cheapest Nights), his novel Al-Haram (1959, The Sin), and his play Al-Farafeer (1964, The Farfoors or The Flipflops).

Jabra’s contribution to modern art was in three ways: as a founding member of the Baghdad Group for Modern Art in 1951 together with the Iraqi artists Jewad Selim and Shakir Hassan Al Said, an art critic, and an artist. 

Jabra writes about his first encounters with art, and more broadly visual culture, in his autobiography al-Bi’r al-ula (The First Well, 1987). 

Most of his paintings done in Iraq were destroyed with his house in 2010. Jabra’s main contribution however has to be seen in his writings as an art critic, especially his publications Jawad Salim wa-nasb al-hurriyya (Jewad Selim and the Monument of Freedom, Baghdad 1974) and al-Fann al-‘iraqi al-muasir (Iraqi Art Today, Baghdad 1970) with which he introduced modern art in Iraq to a broader public.

After graduating from the Arab College in Jerusalem, Jabra went on a scholarship to study English literature at Cambridge University (1939-43).

Apart from two years at Harvard University in the early 1950s and occasional trips abroad, he remained in Baghdad, later as counsellor at the Iraqi Ministry of Culture and Information, until his death in 1994. 

In 2010, his house was destroyed in car bomb explosions that targeted foreign embassies in Baghdad, an event that was considered by some a deathblow to Baghdad’s cultural memory.

Vincent Akwete Kofi was born in Odumasi-Krobo, Ghana.

After training at Achimota College, which had the first and foremost art department in West Africa, he continued his studies at the Royal College of Art, London (1952-55), and Columbia University, New York (1959). 

Oscar Levertin was born at Gryt Manor in Norrköping, Sweden.

He pursued an academic career at Uppsala University, where he received his doctorate in 1888. 

Beginning in 1893 he taught literature and art history at Stockholm College, where he became a professor in 1899. 

Levertin was also employed as a literary critic, joining the daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet in 1897. 

This assault on Naturalism was launched in the pamphlet Pepitas bröllop (1890), co-authored with Verner von Heidenstam.

Hannes Meyer was a Swiss modernist architect, educator, and the second director of the Bauhaus from 1928 to 1930.

He was an apprentice mason and studied building at Basel Technical School for four years before going to Berlin in 1909, where he attended courses on town planning, economics, and land reform. 

In 1936, Meyer returned to Switzerland for three years and then travelled to Mexico. 

He accepted the invitation to become director of the newly formed Institute for Town and National Planning of Mexico, which was closed for lack of funds in 1941. 

Born in Bayonne, NJ, Perle discovered Alban Berg's Lyric Suite when studying with Ernst Krenek in 1937, and went on to develop a compositional system called twelve-tone tonality from the implications of Berg's score.

Nicholas Ray was an American film director, most notable for directing Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and for his complex portraits of a variety of social issues including youth culture, addiction and sexuality. 

Ray’s career in film began in 1944 after having worked with Elia Kazan in the Theater of Action, an improvisatory acting company. Ray’s directorial debut feature, 

They Live by Night (1949), provided a template for a stylized aesthetic that depicted the lives and loves of young loners.

In 1919 Schwitters made his first Merz collages.

After moving to Paris in 1912, he became part of Parisian intellectual and poetic life, attended classes at the Sorbonne, and came into contact with all major cultural personalities of the time, such as Henri Bergson, Guillaume Apollinaire, Pablo Picasso, and the Italian futurists, among others. 

Ungaretti moved to Milan in 1914 and, with Italy’s entry into World War One, volunteered as a soldier in the northern Italian region of Carso from 1915 to 1916. 

This experience intensely affected his poetic production, and was conveyed in his first book of poems, Il Porto Sepolto (The Buried Harbor), published in 1916.

his training instilled in him a passion for artistic processes, as evidenced in the painter’s lifelong habit of stretching his own canvases and preparing tempera paint, a technique he embraced after discovering Giotto in an influential visit to Italy in 1950.

His initial production is mostly figurative. Noteworthy from this early period are his 1939-1941 marine landscapes made in Itanhaém, following his encounter with the painter Ernesto De Fiori. 

From the 1950s onwards his artworks became more abstract.

An interest in women’s suffrage led to her involvement with the New Freewoman and, from 1911, she devoted her inherited wealth to sponsoring the arts, gradually becoming a major patron and publisher of modernism. 

In 1913 she became the business manager of the New Freewoman, taking over from Dora Marsden as editor when it became the Egoist. 

Her financial support was crucial to the success of this literary periodical, which published almost every significant name in modernism, including T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis and Marianne Moore, but only sold 200 copies between 1916 and 1919.

In 1916 she established the Egoist Press to publish Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (previously serialised in The Egoist) and went on to publish several other major works, including Eliot’s first collection of poetry, Prufrock and Other Observations (1917).

Starting in 1914, Weaver gradually became Joyce’s patron and principle source of income.

Sadao Yamanaka was a Japanese film director known for bringing a modern, critical touch to period films in the 1930s. 

Born in Kyoto, he entered the film industry in 1927 and directed his first film at age 22.

Jassim Mohamed Zaini was a leading figure in the development of the fledgling Qatari art scene in the 1960s.

In 1910, he co-founded the Moderne Bund and contributed to the Blue Rider Almanac.
