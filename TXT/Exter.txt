Exter, Alexandra Alexandrovna Grigorovich
Born 6 January 1882 in Bialostok, Belorussia, Imperial Russia
Died 17 March 1949 in Fontenay-aux-Roses, near Paris, France

First exhibiting in Kiev in The Link (1908), Alexandra Exter showed
paintings of 1907 done in France and Switzerland in a Pointillist style.
Passing through a short Czannist period, she adopted structural principles
of Cubism, 1911-1912, to then take up the colour ideas of the Parisian
Simultaneists, Robert Delaunay, Sonia Delaunay and the Synchromists, 1913-
1915. For them, colour is what the eye sees before it sees objects, making
the world a fantastic display of shapes of moving colour between light and
dark which they depicted in their paintings (R. Delaunay, Solar Disc, 1912,
S. Delaunay, Le Bal Bullier, 1913). It was the city at night that Exter
captured in a series of paintings that became increasingly non-objective as
patches of colours began to dominate over the objects. Returning to Russia
in 1914, she was associated with Cubo-Futurist painters  K. Malevich, L.
Popova, et al.  and in 1916 she, like them and others, was using spinning
discs to capture moving colour in light. Exters Dynamism of Colour
series (1916-1918) was entirely non-objective and was followed by her
Colour Constructions composed with beams of light from projectors onto a
screen (1920-1924) and with the circular movement of machines, the
Dynamics of Colour series. Exploring colour and its laws was a main
stream of modernism to which Alexandra Exter was a major contributor.

Very much a part of the modernist trends  Cubism, Simultaneism  in Paris,
Exter brought the ideas inherent to them to her friends in Russia, thereby
contributing to the rise of modernism and the Russian avant-garde. Due to
the First World War and then the 1917 October Revolution, Exter was based
in Russia and not only took part in exhibitions of non-objective art but
became engaged in costume and set design for the theatre (Thamira
Kitharides, 1916, Salome, 1917, Romeo and Juliet, 1921 for Alexander
Tairoff and his Kamerny Theatre, Moscow), and for film (J. Protozanovs,
Aelita, 1924). Living in Kiev from 1917 to 1918, she was involved in arts
programmes for the Bolshevik regime and in an official capacity she was
responsible for installation of the Russian section at the Venice Biennale
(1924) and the Paris Exposition des Arts Dcoratifs et Industriels Modernes
(1925), where she was awarded a gold medal for her theatre work. The
political situation in Russia encouraged Exter to remain in Paris where she
began to paint in a Purist style and taught composition and colour in the
studio of Fernand Lger, the Acadmie Moderne (1925-1929) while also
teaching theatre design in her own studio. In the 1930s she gave her
talents to book design.
