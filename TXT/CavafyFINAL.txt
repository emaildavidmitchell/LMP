Cavafy, C. P.  (1863-1933)
C.  P.  (Constantine  Petrou  Photiades)  Cavafy,  the  youngest  of   seven
brothers, was born in Alexandria, Egypt where he  spent  most  of  his  life
working as a clerk at  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works.  His  parents  were
natives of Constantinople and founding members of  the  Greek  community  of
Alexandria. Cavafy published  his  first  poem  Bacchial  in  the  Leipzig
periodical Hesperus in 1886 and ever since opted  for  publishing  privately
or in newspapers and periodicals  rather  than  in  book  form.  His  poetic
oeuvre consists of 154 poems and was published  posthumously  in  Alexandria
in 1935 and in Athens in 1948. Editions of his unpublished poems, his  prose
and essays followed from the 1960s onwards. Unequivocally dedicated  to  the
craft of poetry  a photo of his last passport, issued in  1932,  lists  his
occupation as Poet  ,  Cavafy  is  known  worldwide  for  poems  such  as
Ithaka (1911) and  Waiting  for  the  Barbarians  (1904)  but  also  for
celebrating the eroticism of young bodies and their sensual  pleasure  (The
Afternoon Sun, 1919) and for resurrecting in verse marginalized  historical
figures (Kaisarion, 1918). W.H.  AUDEN,  who  wrote  the  introduction  to
Cavafys collected poems translated by Rae Dalven in  1961,  found  Cavafys
erotic poems a breakthrough in subject and style,  since  they  were  openly
homosexual and used  every-day  objects,  like  chairs  and  mirrors,  never
before encountered in  traditional  Greek  poetry.  Cavafys  God  Abandons
Anthony was published in THE ATHENAEUM  in 1919 and his  Ithaca  appeared
in T.S. ELIOTs literary journal THE CRITERION  in  1924.  The  associations
with a cultural inheritance that connected Homer, Dante  and  Tennyson  were
not lost on ELIOT who viewed culture as a variety in unity (Notes  towards
the Definition of Culture). Forever  fixed  in  popular  imagination  as  a
Greek gentleman in a straw hat, standing absolutely motionless at  a  slight
angle to the universe, after E.M. FORSTERs 1923 description in Pharos  and
Pharilion, Cavafys work has bequeathed, in Yannis Ritsoss  terms,  a  map
of Greece, like a miniature atlas, /  somewhat  abstracted  and  with  great
inaccuracies  of  frontier  (Misunderstandings,  from  Twelve  Poems  for
Cavafy, 1963).
      For  all  his  everyday  depictions,  his  attention  to  detail,  his
portrayal of the city in timeless settings or  with  philosophical  nuances,
as well as for the ekphrastic effect of his verse, Cavafy can be  considered
the painter of modern  life  in  the  Hellenic  world.  His  work  has  been
translated widely  a volume of 153 poems in 19 languages by 135 poets  from
30 countries, either inspired by Cavafys poetry or conversing with it,  was
published in 2000 under the  title        /Conversing
with Cavafy.
