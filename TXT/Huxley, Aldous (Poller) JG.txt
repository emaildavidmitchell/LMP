|Huxley, Aldous (1894-1963)                                            |
|Huxley, Leonard Aldous                                                |
|Aldous Huxley is best known for his dystopian novel Brave New World   |
|(1932) and his disquisition on psychedelic substances, The Doors of   |
|Perception (1954). In the inter-war years, Huxley commanded a         |
|formidable reputation, and his work was considered alongside the      |
|leading modernists. He was impressively prolific and wrote in a       |
|variety of genres, producing poetry, short stories, essays, novels,   |
|plays, biography and travel writing. His work appeared in many of the |
|modernist Little Magazines, such as Coterie, The Egoist and Wheels.   |
|Huxley was a zealous individualist: while he socialised with Virginia |
|Woolf, Roger Fry and Clive Bell (among others), he was never part of  |
|the Bloomsbury Group; likewise, though a regular guest at Garsington  |
|Manor, the home of society hostess Lady Ottoline Morrell, he was not  |
|regarded as a member of her pacifist coterie that included Lytton     |
|Strachey and Bertrand Russell. After moving to America, Huxley became |
|increasingly concerned with mysticism, and his reputation declined;   |
|however, the work he produced during this period was championed by key|
|figures in the New Age and counter-culture movements, and he played a |
|vital part in popularising Eastern religions in the West, such as     |
|Buddhism, Tantra and Advaita Vedanta.                                 |
|                                                                      |
|Aldous Leonard Huxley was born on 26 July 1894, near Godalming in     |
|Surrey. He came from a distinguished intellectual lineage: his        |
|grandfather was T. H. Huxley, who was nicknamed 'Darwin's bulldog' for|
|his advocacy of evolutionary theory; and his great-uncle was the poet |
|and critic Matthew Arnold. His childhood was marked by three traumatic|
|episodes that helped shape him as a writer: in 1908, his mother Julia |
|died of cancer; three years later, at the age of sixteen, he          |
|contracted an eye infection (keratitis punctata) that permanently     |
|impaired his eyesight; and in 1914, his brother Trevenen committed    |
|suicide.                                                              |
|                                                                      |
|After attending Eton, Huxley read English at Balliol College, Oxford. |
|He attempted to enlist during World War I, but was rejected due to his|
|poor eyesight. Through the hospitality of Ottoline Morrell and her    |
|husband Philip, Huxley met many eminent artists and intellectuals,    |
|including T.S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf and W.B. Yeats, as well as the   |
|Belgian refugee Maria Nys (1898-1955), whom he married in 1919.       |
|                                                                      |
|His first published book was a volume of poetry, The Burning Wheel    |
|(1916). Despite the modernist experimentation of contemporary poets   |
|such as Ezra Pound, Huxley's poetry was fairly conventional and       |
|favoured traditional forms (most of the poems in the collection are   |
|sonnets). Huxley's first novel, Crome Yellow (1921), similarly        |
|eschewed the formal experimentation of his modernist peers and drew   |
|comparisons with the work of the satirist Thomas Love Peacock         |
|(1785-1866). On the other hand, Huxley's London-based novels of the   |
|1920s, Antic Hay (1923) and Point Counter Point (1928), vividly       |
|captured the post-war mood of anomie, amorality and empty hedonism. In|
|addition, some of his early work has an avant-garde edge (for example |
|the prose poems Back Streets and Beauty and his experimental play |
|Happy Families), and was published in the modernist Little Magazines|
|alongside the work of T.S. Eliot, Wyndham Lewis, Katherine Mansfield, |
|Jacob Epstein, Pablo Picasso and Ezra Pound. Above all, Huxley was a  |
|novelist of ideas whose work was a barometer of the intellectual      |
|atmosphere of his era. For instance, in the 1920s and 30s he satirised|
|psychoanalysis, examined the impact of quantum physics, deplored the  |
|standardisation that was occurring in art as well as industry,        |
|explored mysticism, advocated eugenics, and propounded a philosophy   |
|loosely based on the Weltanschauung of his friend D. H. Lawrence.     |
|                                                                      |
|Huxley's classic novel Brave New World (1932) was a baleful vision of |
|what the world would look like if the mechanistic ideas of J. B.      |
|Watson, Sigmund Freud, Henry Ford and H. G. Wells were given free     |
|reign. Watsons behaviourism can be found in the neo-Pavlovian       |
|conditioning the children of the World State undergo as part of their|
|caste indoctrination; the perils of the Oedipus complex are avoided by|
|the eradication of the family, and all curbs on the pleasure principle|
|are removed in a society that encourages sexual promiscuity and       |
|recreational drugs (in the form of soma) and proscribes religion;     |
|Fords rationalisation of industry is taken to its reductio ad        |
|absurdum, in that the citizens of the World State are genetically     |
|engineered in order to fit their job and factory; and the novel as a  |
|whole can be read as a satirical response to the utopian fictions of  |
|Wells, such as A Modern Utopia (1905), in which a hierarchical World  |
|State, ruled by an intellectual elite, has eliminated the problems    |
|besetting mankind through the application of science and technology.  |
|                                                                      |
|In 1934-35, Huxley suffered from insomnia and depression and made some|
|decisive changes to his life as a result. Encouraged by his friend and|
|fellow polymath Gerald Heard, Huxley began to meditate and joined what|
|would become the Peace Pledge Union. Having been alternately attracted|
|and repelled by mysticism in the 1920s, Huxley began to espouse a     |
|mystical philosophy, both in his work with the Peace Pledge Union     |
|(under whose auspices he wrote the 1936 pamphlet What Are You Going to|
|Do About It? The Case for Constructive Peace) and in his fiction. He  |
|drew on many of these experiences in his novel Eyeless In Gaza (1936),|
|which charts the spiritual journey of Anthony Beavis, who grows       |
|disillusioned with his cynical life of loveless affairs and ivy-tower |
|elitism, and becomes an exponent of mysticism and pacifism.           |
|                                                                      |
|Huxley undertook a lecture tour of America in 1937 and ended up       |
|settling in California. Maria had been anxious to find an American    |
|university for their son Matthew (1920-2005), so he would be sheltered|
|from the looming European conflict, and Huxley was attracted by the   |
|potential to make money in Hollywood, though in practice he found the |
|work uncongenial and only three of his screenplays went into          |
|production. Huxley felt incredibly guilty about sitting out World War |
|II in Los Angeles and received stinging criticism in the British press|
|for mystic naval gazing, despite the fact that in 1939 he was 45 years|
|old and was virtually blind in one eye. Rather than being swayed by   |
|such criticism, though, Huxley became more than ever convinced that   |
|mysticism was the key to forestalling further conflict. He            |
|consolidated his knowledge of Eastern mysticism through his           |
|association with Swami Prabhavananda, the head of the Vedanta Society |
|for Southern California, and the Indian sage and former messiah of the|
|Theosophical Society Jiddu Krishnamurti. He also visited Heards      |
|spiritual community, Trabuco College, and co-authored its prospectus. |
|His fiction became a vehicle for his mystical insights, most notably  |
|After Many a Summer (1939), Time Must Have a Stop (1944) and The      |
|Genius and the Goddess (1955). He also wrote a biography of the       |
|Catholic mystic Father Joseph, Grey Eminence (1941), and a book about |
|the demonisation of the seventeenth-century priest Urbain Grandier,   |
|The Devils of Loudon (1952), which was subsequently made into a film  |
|by the director Ken Russell.                                          |
|                                                                      |
|In 1945, Huxley published an anthology of mystical writings, The      |
|Perennial Philosophy, in which he argued that while mystics from the  |
|Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Sufi traditions conceived of God       |
|differently, their experiences of union with the godhead, or what     |
|Huxley termed the Divine Ground, and the insights they derived from   |
|this, were essentially the same. For Huxley, this constituted         |
|empirical evidence that there was a unified metaphysical realm beyond |
|the phenomenal world of diversity. In The Perennial Philosophy, Huxley|
|argues that mans final end is to achieve unitive knowledge of the |
|Godhead. The experience of mystical union, however, is only possible |
|for a tiny portion of the population, and Huxley was frustrated by his|
|failure to achieve this through the conventional techniques of        |
|meditation and asceticism. As a result of his experiments with        |
|mescaline and LSD, Huxley was finally able to apprehend the           |
|metaphysical dimension of reality. The books The Doors of Perception  |
|(1954) and Heaven and Hell (1956) record his psychedelic experiences  |
|and the conclusions he drew from them. They catalysed considerable    |
|counterculture interest in Hindu philosophies such as Tantra and Zen  |
|Buddhism and exerted a great influence on the psychologist Timothy    |
|Leary, who corresponded with Huxley and refused to heed his prophetic |
|warning that widespread use of psychedelic substances among the       |
|general public would lead to their prohibition.                       |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|Maria Huxley died of breast cancer in 1955, and the following year    |
|Huxley married the former violinist and psychotherapist Laura Archera |
|(1911-2007), whose memoir of her life with Huxley, This Timeless      |
|Moment, was published in 1968. In the aftermath of Marias death,     |
|Huxley allegedly received two messages from her through Eileen        |
|Garrett, a friend and spirit medium who had established the           |
|Parapsychology Foundation in 1951. Huxley had long been interested in |
|the paranormal and treated the subject of spiritualism in his play The|
|World of Light (1931). He also wrote essays extolling the work of the |
|American parapsychologist Joseph Banks Rhine and in 1956 he became a  |
|member of the Society for Psychical Research.                         |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|Despite Huxley's commitment to mysticism, and his open-minded attitude|
|to the paranormal, he never abandoned his faith in science, and in his|
|later work, such as Island (1962) and Literature and Science (1963),  |
|he argued that if we want to maximise our 'human potentialities' we   |
|need to embrace both. Indeed, Island is often read as a Tantric utopia|
|to the technological dystopia of Brave New World, and the population  |
|of Pala embody a harmonious balance of mind and body, Western science |
|and Eastern philosophy, modern medicine and the moksha-medicine     |
|(psilocybin mushrooms).                                               |
|                                                                      |
|Huxley died of throat cancer on the day of John F. Kennedy's          |
|assassination, 22 November 1963. His essays have been collected in the|
|Complete Essays (6 vols., 2000-02), edited by James Sexton and Robert |
|S. Baker; and two separate volumes of his correspondence have been    |
|published, edited by Grover Smith (1969) and James Sexton (2007)      |
|respectively.                                                         |
