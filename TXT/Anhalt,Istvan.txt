Anhalt, Istvan (1919-2012)
Robin Elliott


Istvan Anhalt was a Hungarian-born Canadian composer and one of the leading
figures in avant-garde composition during the second half of the 20th
century in Canada. Nearly all of his major compositions were written after
his emigration to Canada in 1949. In his works he made use at various times
of dodecaphony, electronic music, and extended vocal techniques. Many of
his most significant compositions are for orchestra, but he contributed to
all major genres, from solo instrumental works to opera. From the mid-1970s
onwards he began to use more traditional compositional techniques, from
which he fashioned an original, distinctive, and evocative idiom. In
addition to his work as a composer, Anhalt had an important career as a
university music professor and administrator (at McGill University and then
at Queens University in Kingston) and he was also known for his work as an
insightful music theorist. About half of his two dozen or so major
compositions were completed after his retirement from academia in 1984.

Early career in Europe:

Istvan Anhalt was born and raised in Budapest. He received his initial
education in music there, at first privately and then (1937-41) at the
Franz Liszt Academy of Music, where he was a pupil of Zoltn Kodly and
Albert Sikls. His earliest compositions date from this period, notably the
song cycle Six Songs from Na Conxy Pan. In 1942 Anhalt was conscripted into
the Hungarian forced labour service system for Jewish men. Late in 1944 he
fled from his unit and spent the remainder of the war in hiding. Realizing
that his prospects in post-war Budapest were uncertain at best, he left
Hungary as a displaced person early in 1946 and made his way to Paris.
During a three-year sojourn there, Anhalt studied composition with Nadia
Boulanger. In January 1949 he emigrated to Montreal to begin teaching at
McGill University.

The Montreal years:

Anhalt remained at McGill from 1949 to 1971; he became a full professor in
1967 and served as the chair of the music theory department (1963-69) and
director of the Electronic Music Studio, which he founded (1964-71). The
major work from his early years at McGill was the Symphony for full
orchestra, which together with the later orchestral work SparkskrapS (1987)
is the subject of a major analytical article by William E. Benjamin
(published in Elliott and Smith, 2001). Benjamin identifies the works
written from 1941 to 1953 (ending with the Piano Trio) as broadly
neoclassical in idiom. This period was followed by a serialist phase (1954-
58) which includes the Violin Sonata and Fantasia for piano (recorded by
Glenn Gould) in addition to the Symphony. Influenced by the electronic
music pioneer Hugh Le Caine, whom he met and befriended in Ottawa in 1958,
and by the circle around Karlheinz Stockhausen, with whom he worked during
a brief visit to the Westdeutscher Rundfunks electronic music studios in
Cologne in 1958, Anhalt immersed himself in electronic music. He organized
the first tape music concert given in Canada (Montreal, 30 November 1959),
created four electronic music compositions (1959-61), and set up the
Electronic Music Studio at McGill in 1964 with Le Caines help. He used
recorded sounds in a handful of other works up to the mid-1970s, but was
not involved in electroacoustic music thereafter. During the 1960s he
became increasingly interested in the voice, including extended vocal
techniques and other new directions in vocal composition. His researches in
this field are evident not only in his own compositions, such as Cento
(1967), Foci (1969), and his later operatic works, but also in his
publications as a music scholar, especially his monograph Alternative
Voices (1984).

The Kingston years:

In 1971 Anhalt moved to Kingston, Ontario to become head of the Music
Department at Queens University. He served two five-year terms in that
position, and continued to teach at Queens until his retirement in 1984. A
major event during his tenure there was the construction of a purpose-built
music building, which opened in 1974. Academic duties at Queens curtailed
his compositional output; only two major works date from this thirteen-year
period, the operas La Tourangelle (a Musical Tableau about Marie de
lIncarnation, founder of the Urusline order in New France; premiered in
1975) and Winthrop (a Musical Pageant about John Winthrop, the English
Puritan founder of Boston; premiered in 1986), both to libretti by Anhalt
and premiered in concert versions without staging. His retirement years
were enormously productive ones; he completed two works for voice and
orchestra, also to his own libretti  Traces (Tikkun), a Pluri-Drama for
baritone (1995; dedicated to the memory of four classmates at the Liszt
Academy who perished in the Holocaust) and Millennial Mall (Lady Diotimas
Walk), a Voice-Drama for the Imagination for soprano (1999)  as well as
a string quartet movement in memory of Glenn Gould (1992), six orchestral
works (1987-2004), and his last completed work, Four Portraits from Memory,
which exists in versions for piano (2006) and orchestra (2007), and is the
subject of a study by Friedemann Sallis (in Sallis, Elliott and DeLong,
2011). He also wrote a libretto and extensive musical sketches for
Oppenheimer, an opera about the father of the atomic bomb, between 1987 and
1991, but abandoned the project when he and the Canadian Opera Company
could not reach an agreement about the terms of a planned commission.

Istvan Anhalts entire output as a composer is not large  there are about
three dozen works, completed over a period of 60 years from 1947 to 2007.
The entire oeuvre performed back to back would last about twelve hours. Two
dozen of these compositions are major works and the rest are shorter works
or juvenilia. With the exception of Symphony of Modules (1967), which has
never been performed, all of the works received notable premieres, but only
a handful were performed more than once. The four late orchestral works
were all premiered by the Kingston Symphony under Glen Fast, bringing late
but welcome recognition for Anhalt in the city that he called home for the
last forty years of his life. Only eleven of his works appeared on
recordings, but others are available online via Centrestreams, the Canadian
Music Centres streaming audio service. Anhalts stature as a heavyweight
among Canadian composers (Kasemets), together with a growing body of
scholarly work on his music, suggest that he will retain his place as an
important voice in Canadian composition of his era.
