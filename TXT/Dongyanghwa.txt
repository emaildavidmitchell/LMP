Dongyanghwa, or  Oriental Painting
Dongyanghwa  (,  Jap.  toyoei),  or  Oriental  painting,  are  brush
paintings made with ink or color on either paper  or  silk.  In  the  Joseon
Dynasty, such paintings were  associated  with  calligraphy  and  classified
under the term seohwa (calligraphy and  painting).  Originally,  the  term
dongyang meant the Eastern World, that is it referred  to  the  Orient
in a Western context, as well as the  contrast  between  Asian  civilization
and the West, particularly during the Meiji period. From this developed  the
concept of dongyanghwa, which was originally used to refer  specifically  to
Chinese and Japanese paintings of the late 19th century in Japan. The first-
known official use of the term dongyanghwa in Korea  came  in  1915,  when
the  Joseon  Product  Exhibition  (Joseon  mulsan  gongjinhoe)  divided  the
displayed artwork between dongyanghwa and Western painting. After this,  the
Joseon Art Exhibition (Joseon Misul Jeollamhoe), which  was  established  in
1922, used dongyanghwa as the  name  of  one  section  of  its  competition.
Korean artists continued to use the term seohwa for a  while,  and  formed
the Calligraphy and Painting Association (Seohwa hyeophoe) for  artists  and
calligraphers working in  that  style.  Starting  in  the  1970s,  the  term
hangukhwa (Korean painting) also began to be used to highlight the  unique
features of Korean art.
