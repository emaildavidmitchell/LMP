Anand, Mulk Raj (1905-2004)



Sharon Pillai





Mulk Raj Anand, together with Raja Rao and R. K. Narayan, made up a distinguished trio in the vanguard of twentieth century Indian writing in English. His roles as essayist, short story writer, playwright, art critic, food critic, editor, activist and social commentator over a near century-long life attest to his versatile genius and varied interests. However, Anand’s foremost claim to fame today is as a novelist whose commitment to artistic verisimilitude and social justice compellingly redrew the ambit of literary representation in India to include marginalised subjectivities and subaltern realities.

Mulk Raj Anand was born to a provincial Kshatriya Punjabi family in Peshawar. His father, Lal Chand, being a subordinate functionary in the colonial army, Anand’s formative years were spent in the cantonments of Nowshera and Mian Mir. During his years at Khalsa College in Amritsar, Anand got to know the poet Mohammad Iqbal. He also got involved briefly in anti-colonial activities. Faced with familial strife and emotional tangles, Anand, with Iqbal’s encouragement, set sail to do a PhD in England in 1925. He won a scholarship to University College, London, where he worked on a dissertation on British philosophy, and was awarded a doctorate in 1929.



His years in Britain brought Anand into contact with many leading intellectuals of the West, including the Bloomsbury group (among them, Forster, Eliot, Woolf), Orwell, Lawrence, Russell, Neruda, and Malraux. It also exposed him to Marxist thought, which was to become a key shaper of his socialist commitments and growing conviction that literature and politics are ever intertwined. Anand became increasingly active in left wing political circles, and took a keen interest in India’s struggle for independence, especially Gandhi’s leadership. Refusing an offer from Cambridge University, he worked at various jobs to support himself, ranging from editor at Hogarth Press and Criterion, to lecturing at Adult Educational Schools and Workers Educational Association. He was one of the founding members of the Progressive Writers Association in London, 1935. In 1945, at the cessation of the War, Anand returned to India. He started and edited the art journal, Marg, and taught at several institutions, including the universities of Punjab and Rajasthan. In 1965, Anand was appointed Fine Art Chairman of the Lalit Kala Akademi. He was awarded the World Peace Council prize in1952 and the Padma Bhushan in1968. Anand died of pneumonia in Pune on 25th Sept 2004.  



Anand’s first novel, Untouchable, was rejected 19 times before it was published through Forster’s recommendation in 1935. Many of his novels centre around categories of the socially underprivileged and dispossessed: Untouchable highlights the problem of caste discrimination, Coolie the poor under industrial capitalism, Two Leaves and a Bud the economic travails of the Indian peasantry, and Gauri the plight of a poor woman in a class stratified, patriarchal society. At the time of his death Anand was working on his magnum opus, a seven-volume autobiographical novel, Seven Ages of Man, of which five volumes, beginning with Seven Summers (1951), have been published.
