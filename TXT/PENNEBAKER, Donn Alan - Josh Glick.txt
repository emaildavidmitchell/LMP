PENNEBAKER, Donn Alan (D.A.) (July 15, 1925)

A passionate observer of Americas most significant cultural icons and
political personalities, documentary filmmaker Donn Alan (D.A.) Pennebaker
was born in Evanston, Illinois in 1925. He studied mechanical engineering
at Yale University and served in the Naval Air Corps during World War II
before helping to create the New York-based documentary company Drew
Associates in 1960. Working with Robert Drew, Albert Maysles, and Richard
Leacock on films about John F. Kennedys administration, Pennebaker became
a pioneer of the incipient style of American direct cinema. Both a highly
technical practice as well as an aesthetic craft, this mode of production
involved the synchronous recording of sound and image along with fluid
cinematography that immersed the viewer in the unfolding action.
      Frustrated with the strictures of commercial television and searching
for more artistic freedom to register the sensory experience of being part
of an event, Pennebaker left Drew Associates in 1963. Drawn to the American
counterculture, Pennebaker shot Bob Dylans 1965 tour in England (Dont Look
Back [1967]) and recorded the rock stars and audience at the Monterey
International Pop Music Festival in 1967 (Monterey Pop [1968]). During the
mid-1970s, Pennebaker formed a lasting personal and professional
partnership with the filmmaker Chris Hegedus. The team tracked charismatic
musicians (Depeche Mode 101 [1989], Only the Strong Survive [2002]) and
Bill Clintons 1992 presidential campaign (The War Room [1993]), as well as
documented inventors and entrepreneurs. Pennebaker continued to embrace his
signature filming technique: shifting between extreme close-ups of
individuals facial expressions and gestures and long-shots depicting whole
scenes of activity, thus encouraging viewers to pay attention to and
reflect on how people perform within social settings. For his extraordinary
contributions to documentary filmmaking, in 2012 Pennebaker was honoured
with a Governors Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
