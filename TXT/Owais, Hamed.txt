Owais, Hamed (1919  2011)                              200 words

Born in Beni Soueif, Egypt, Hamed Owais is one of the leading painters of
Egyptian social realism. He was a partisan of the ideals of the Gamal Abdel
Nasser era and was inspired by Mexican muralists, such as Diego Rivera and
David Alfaro Siqueiros. His work portrays the daily life of the Egyptian
working class through a clear and direct style, reflecting the strength of
his social convictions. Having graduated from the School of Fine Arts in
Cairo in 1944, he pursued his studies at the Institute of Art Education in
Cairo where he received his diploma in 1946. A year later, he founded,
together with other artists of his generation, the Egyptian Group of
Modern Art. Following a teaching career at the Faculty of Fine Arts in
Alexandria, he received a scholarship in 1967 to study at the Royal Academy
of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid. On his return to Egypt, he served
as the head of the Faculty of Fine Arts in Alexandria (1977  1979).
