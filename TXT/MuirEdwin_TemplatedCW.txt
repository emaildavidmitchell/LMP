Muir, Edwin (1887–1959)

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

Born into an Orkney farming family that suffered a traumatic transplantation to industrialised Glasgow in 1901, Edwin Muir came to literary prominence with We Moderns (1918), a series of aphoristic essays first published in A. R. Orage’s New Age. The book’s success in America resulted in a contract with the Freeman magazine which enabled him to travel in Europe with his wife Willa, thus making the contact with German language and culture which resulted in their later translations of Kafka’s fiction. Muir’s reputation in the 1920s was primarily as critic of the new writing of T. S. Eliot, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf in books such as Transition (1926). Although his First Poems was published by Hogarth Press in 1925, his mature contribution to modernist poetry came later in collections such as The Labyrinth (1949) and One Foot in Eden (1956). His autobiography (1954) is considered a classic of the genre. Muir’s writings made a significant contribution to Scottish Modernism, although as an Orkneyman he considered Scotland his second country. He is now increasingly recognised for his European qualities.
