Costa Rican architect Hernn Jimnez-Fonseca obtained his degree at the
Universidad Autnoma de Mexico (UNAM) in 1970. Like many Costa Rican
architects of his generation, he trained abroad since there were no
architecture degree courses in the country until 1971. After settling back
in Costa Rica he designed the National Bank Agency in Puriscal, which was
built in 1973. But it was in 1976, when he won the competition for the
Costa Rican Association of Engineers and Architects building that there
came a turning point in his career. With its monumental concrete structure
and distinctive form, the building became a significant reference in Costa
Rican architecture. Throughout his career, and alongside his designs for
residential, religious, and institutional architecture (Pinares Apartment
Block, 1980; Turrialba Catholic Church, 1999; Fire Station in Puriscal,
1982), Jimnez-Fonseca won a number of important competitions, such as the
National Assembly in 1991 (un-built) and the National Center for Culture in
1994. He was also a member of the Jury for high-profile urban projects such
as the Square for Democracy. As a competition-winner and jury-member,
Jimenez Fonseca left a lasting and influential mark on the urban setting of
the countrys capital.

A further aspect of Jimnez-Fonsecas valuable contribution to Costa Rican
architecture is his long-standing effort to enhance its academic culture.
In 1975, he became part of the first School of Architecture at the
University of Costa Rica, holding the post of professor from 1997 until his
retirement in 2005.  His teaching focused on the language of section, plan,
and facade as a means of structure and volume design. He was also
particularly attentive to a certain truth-to-materials ethos (his
architecture is chiefly composed of exposed concrete and brick) and to the
organization of spatial qualities in terms of firmness, robustness, and
stability.
