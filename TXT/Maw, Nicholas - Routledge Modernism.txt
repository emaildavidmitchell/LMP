 (John) Nicholas Maw (1935-2009)

Edward Venn

Nicholas Maw was one of the leading British composers of his generation.
His music balances modernist sensibilities with musical and expressive
impulses derived from Late Romanticism, often on a large scale and with
reference to traditional genres. In later life he relocated to the United
States of America, where he died from heart failure, with complications
from diabetes.

Though born into a musical family in Grantham, Lincolnshire, Maw only began
composing at the instigation of a school music teacher at the age of
fifteen. He subsequently studied at the Royal Academy of Music (1955-8)
with Lennox Berkeley; both the Academy and London in general provided an
environment where he could for the first time encounter early twentieth
century modernist music (in particular that of the Second Viennese School)
and more contemporary idioms. Supported by a French Government scholarship,
Maw continued his education in France with Nadia Boulanger (who helped him
secure the Lili Boulanger Prize in order to remain in Paris for a further
six months) and Max Deutsch. Though Maws earliest works, such as the EIGHT
CHINESE LYRICS (1956) and NOCTURNE (1957-8) already demonstrated
familiarity with the music of the Second Viennese School (as well as that
of Britten), the compositions Maw produced on his return to England, such
as the SIX CHINESE SONGS (1959) revealed a Boulezian influence.

A crisis of confidence emanating in part from stylistic concerns led in the
ESSAY FOR ORGAN (1961) and above all in SCENES AND ARIAS for three female
voices and large orchestra (1962; rev. 1966) to a rapprochement between the
rigour inherited from serial thinking and the sensuousness of late Romantic
lyricism and harmonic language. In his own words, Maw 'put [his] roots in
the place where [he] felt they need to be put down: in the music of before
the First World War'. In practice, this led to a fruitful tension between
modernist fragmentation and Romantic expressive values, a tension borne out
in subsequent works such as the STRING QUARTET No. 1 (1965), SINFONIA
(1966), and the two comic operas ONE MAN SHOW (1964) and THE RISING OF THE
MOON (1967-70).

A commission to write for the London Symphony Orchestra in 1972 led
eventually to ODYSSEY (1972-87), an unbroken 90-minute work for orchestra
in which Romantic compositional principles are expanded to extremes (for
instance, the treatment of lengthy musical themes as individual motifs).
This, and Maw's music of the 1970s and 80s more generally, can thus be
understood in part as a positive exploration of the music of the late
nineteenth century in the light of the late twentieth. Further examples
include the manipulations of texture and density in LIFE STUDIES for 15
strings (1973-6), the composition of character pieces PERSONAE for piano
(1973; 1985-6), and rethinking of genre, as in the SONATA NOTTURNA, which
is in effect a concerto for cello and strings.

In later years, Maw's music continued to explore melodic writing on the
largest scale, but with an increasingly clear tonal focus, as can be found
in the expansive VIOLIN CONCERTO (1993) and the choral-orchestral HYMNUS
(1995-96). Alongside such grand public gestures exist finely crafted
chamber works, including three further STRING QUARTETS (1982, 1994-5, and
2005) and choral works such as ONE FOOT IN EDEN STILL, I STAND (1990). The
key work of this period was the opera SOPHIES CHOICE, which occupied Maw
from 1990 to 2002. Though critics took Maws assemblage of a libretto from
William Styrons book to task, his lucid orchestral writing and generous
lyricism garnered praise.
