Yury Annenkov’s portrait of Pilniak, 1924.

Yury Annenkov’s portrait of Pilniak, 1924.Leading Russian ornamentalist prose writer. Pilniak’s debut novel Golyi god (The Naked Year) established him as one of the leading authors of Russian modernism, an innovator in literary form who defied cultural taboos.  A so-called fellow traveler of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, who accepted the revolution without becoming a Party member, Pilniak adopted the ideal of progress, though an enthusiasm for the heritage of rural, anarchistic Russia remained a touchstone in his work.  The dynamic, impressionistic prose style that Pilniak cultivated—fragmentary montages held together by allusive imagery and resonant refrains, romanticizing revolutionary ideals and sacrifices—was dubbed ‘ornamental prose.’ It inspired numerous imitations through the mid 1920s.  Pilniak used his influence as a Soviet author to advocate for the writer’s need for independence from ideology and to help organise and direct the broad-minded publishing house Krug (1922-1929).  Controversy haunted many of his later efforts to craft an authentic response to his times, even as he sought to integrate the expected social themes.   He was arrested in 1937 and executed in 1938.

Pilniak at his writing desk in Kolomna, 1922.

Pilniak at his writing desk in Kolomna, 1922.Boris Andreevich Pilniak (born Vogau) was born 11 October (29 September old-style) 1894 in Mozhaisk, Russia. His father was a veterinarian of German descent, his mother a teacher from a Saratov family of merchants and craftsmen. Through early adult hood Pilniak lived in country towns south and east of Moscow where he acquired a deep empathy for Russia’s folk customs and traditions and for nature and man’s primal being.   He grew to believe that culture and the enlightened use of technology promised by the Bolsheviks were the necessary antidotes to Russia’s backwardness and poverty.

Through correspondence courses, Pilniak earned a degree in economics in 1920 from the Moscow Commercial Institute that he never used professionally.  He began publishing under the pen name Pilniak after Russia entered World War I. An early collection of short stories Byl’e (Bygones, 1920) benefited from the notice of those with whom he was forging literary ties through participation in new post-revolutionary organisations like the Moscow Palace of Arts, supported by the Bolshevik cultural establishment, and the liberal All-Russia Union of Writers.  Critics noted the influence of Pilniak’s elder contemporaries on his distinctive style—Alexei Remizov’s folkloric stylizations and Andrei BELY’s musical, rhythmic prose—but in The Naked Year they also recognized a talented and convincing portrayal of their own chaotic times.

Pilniak’s literary success encouraged him to take an active role in literary politics of the 1920s and also gave him uncommon opportunities to travel.  A trip to Berlin in 1922 led to useful if problematic connections with émigré publishers and enhanced his reputation abroad as a chronicler of new Russia.  Travel throughout the Soviet Union and to Western Europe, Egypt, the Arctic, Asia, and the United States over the 1920s and 1930s yielded material for numerous topical sketches and travelogues.

A second experimental novel Mashiny i volky (Machines and Wolves, 1925) looked for an elusive synthesis of the conflicting motives of civilization and nature, reason and instinct. A short story “Povest’ nepogashennoi luny” (A Tale of the Unextinguished Moon, 1926) implicated Stalin in the death of a rival Bolshevik and Pilniak had to apologize for this critical misstep. Two years later, the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP) launched a campaign vilifying Pilniak as a writer hostile to the Soviet state.  He was forced to resign his leadership role in the Writers Union in 1929 and found it increasingly difficult to publish. 

Pilniak turned from modernist devices to write an early and original version of the novel of socialist construction promoting Stalin’s Five-year Plan, Volga vpadaet v Kaspiiskoe more (The Volga Flows to the Caspian Sea, 1930).  He chronicled the drowning of accumulated remnants of pre-revolutionary life behind a new hydroelectric dam.  By reworking an earlier story Krasnoe derevo (Mahogany, 1929) into the plot of the novel (a characteristic strategy), he chose material that had already been labeled libelous by RAPP. Critics from the right and left accused him of artistic and moral compromise.  

Pilniak’s subsequent fiction and travelogues in the1930s relied heavily on journalistic themes and techniques, although he continued to aim for original treatment of his material, as in the historical novel Solianoi ambar (Salt Barn, 1937), not published until fifty years after his death. Following his arrest as a Trotskyist sympathizer in October 1937 and execution 21 April 1938, his name was excised from Soviet Russian literature.  It was not until the 1990s that his contributions were again recognized in Russia.
