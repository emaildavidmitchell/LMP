Cesar Gemayel, Cesar (1898-1958 Lebanon)



Cesar Gemayel marks a transition in the history of art in Lebanon from the
commissioned, academic portraits of his predecessors to the portrayal of
landscapes, nudes, and still lifes in oil, watercolor.  His work is, and
pastel and characteriszed by an experimentation with the light, color, and
loose brushstroke in the tradition of European Impressionism. Gemayel
apprenticed in the atelier of Lebanese painter, Khalil Saleeby (1870-1928),
well known for his portraits and nudes depicted with an Impressionist focus
on light. In 1927, he travelled to Paris to study at the Academie Julien
(1927-30) and became of admirer of Auguste Renoir. Gemayel returned to
Beirut in 1930 and dedicated himself to his art. He was a founding faculty
member and one time director of the department of Art and Architecture
(est. 1943) at LAcadmie Libanaise des Beaux-Arts (ALBA, est. 1937.
Gemayels extraordinary body of nudes in oil, pastel, and watercolor
document a sustained experimentation with the effects of light infused
colour and rhythmic brushstrokes. Gemayels figural work is accompanied by
a substantial body of landscapes and still lifves depicted in various
degrees of abstraction, hovering between a three-dimensional painted
reality and a two-dimensional patterned surface.
