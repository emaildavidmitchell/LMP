BRUCE MATHER

Paul Bazin

	

	Composer Bruce Mather (b. 1939) first studied music in Toronto before travelling to France and then settling in Montreal becoming a board member of the newly founded Société de musique contemporaine du Québec (SMCQ). A francophile and wine lover, Mather is the author of a catalogue in which many titles were inspired by notable wines, such as his cello quartet Pommard (2009). His music maintains a special relationship to poetry, the source of pieces such as his Trois poèmes de Gatien Lapointe (2004) and his lauded opera La princesse blanche (1993-1994). In the 1970s, Mather’s encounter with the franco-Russian composer Ivan Wyschnegradsky marked a turning point in his career: while recording the composer’s piano music, Mather adopted Wyschnegradsky’s microtonal system of composition.
