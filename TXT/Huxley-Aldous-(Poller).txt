Huxley, (Leonard) Aldous (1894-1963)

Aldous Huxley is best known for his dystopian novel, BRAVE NEW WORLD
(1932), and his disquisition on psychedelic substances, THE DOORS OF
PERCEPTION (1954). In the inter-war years, Huxley commanded a formidable
reputation and his work was considered in the same breath as the leading
modernists. He was impressively prolific and wrote in a variety of genres,
producing poetry, short stories, essays, novels, plays, biography and
travel writing. His work appeared in many of the modernist LITTLE
MAGAZINES, such as Coterie, The Egoist and Wheels. Huxley was a zealous
individualist: while he socialised with Virginia Woolf, Roger Fry and Clive
Bell (among others), he was never part of the Bloomsbury Group. Likewise,
though a regular guest at Garsington Manor, the home of society hostess
Lady Ottoline Morrell, he was not regarded as a member of her pacifist
coterie that included Lytton Strachey and Bertrand Russell. After moving to
America, Huxley became increasingly concerned with mysticism, and his
reputation declined; however, the work he produced during this period was
championed by key figures in the New Age and counter-culture movements, and
he played a vital part in popularising Eastern religions in the West, such
as Buddhism, Tantra and Advaita Vedanta.

Aldous Huxley was born on 26 July 1894, near Godalming in Surrey. He came
from a distinguished intellectual lineage: his grandfather was T.H. Huxley,
who was nicknamed 'Darwin's bulldog' for his advocacy of evolutionary
theory; and his great uncle was the poet and critic Matthew Arnold. His
childhood was marked by three traumatic episodes that helped shape him as a
writer: in 1908, his mother Julia died of cancer; three years later, at the
age of sixteen, he contracted an eye infection that permanently impaired
his eyesight; and in 1914, his brother Trevenen committed suicide.

After attending Eton, Huxley read English at Balliol College, Oxford. He
attempted to enlist during WORLD WAR I, but was rejected due to his poor
eyesight. Through the hospitality of OTTOLINE MORRELL and her husband
Philip, Huxley met many eminent artists and intellectuals, as well as the
Belgian refugee Maria Nys, whom he married in 1919.

His first published book was a volume of poetry, THE BURNING WHEEL (1916).
Despite the modernist experimentation of other poets at this time, such as
EZRA POUND, Huxley's poetry was fairly conventional and favoured
traditional forms. Likewise, Huxley's first novel, CROME YELLOW (1921),
eschewed the formal experimentation of his modernist contemporaries and
drew comparisons with the work of Thomas Love Peacock (1785-1866). On the
other hand, Huxley's London-based novels of the 1920s,  ANTIC HAY (1923)
and POINT COUNTER POINT (1928), vividly captured the post-war mood of
anomie, amorality and empty hedonism. Moreover, Huxley was a novelist of
ideas whose work serves as a barometer of the intellectual atmosphere of
his era. For instance, in his early work he satirised psychoanalysis,
examined the impact of quantum physics, deplored the standardisation that
was occurring in art as well as industry, explored mysticism, advocated
eugenics, and propounded a philosophy loosely based on the Weltanschauung
of his friend D.H. LAWRENCE. Huxley's classic novel BRAVE NEW WORLD (1932)
was a baleful vision of what the world would look like if the mechanistic
ideas of J.B. Watson, Sigmund Freud, Henry Ford and H.G. Wells were given
free reign.

In 1934-35, Huxley suffered from insomnia and depression and made some
decisive changes to his life as a result. Encouraged by his friend and
fellow polymath Gerald Heard, Huxley began to meditate and joined what
would become the Peace Pledge Union. Having been alternately attracted and
repelled by mysticism in the 1920s, Huxley began to espouse a mystical
philosophy, both in his work with the Peace Pledge Union, under whose
auspices he wrote the pamphlet WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? THE CASE
FOR CONSTRUCTIVE PEACE (1936), and in his fiction. He drew on many of these
experiences in his novel EYELESS IN GAZA (1936), which charts the spiritual
journey of Anthony Beavis, who grows disillusioned with his cynical life of
loveless affairs and ivy-tower elitism, and becomes an exponent of
mysticism and pacifism.

In 1937, Huxley undertook a lecture tour of America and ended up settling
in California. Here he consolidated his knowledge of Eastern mysticism
through his association with Swami Prabhavananda, the head of the Vedanta
Society for Southern California, and the Indian sage and former Theosophist
Jiddu Krishnamurti. His fiction became a vehicle for his mystical insights,
most notably AFTER MANY A SUMMER (1939), TIME MUST HAVE A STOP (1944) and
THE GENIUS AND THE GODDESS (1954). He also wrote a biography of the
Catholic mystic Father Joseph, GREY EMINENCE (1941), and a book about the
demonisation of the seventeenth-century priest Urbain Grandier, THE DEVILS
OF LOUDON (1952). In 1945, Huxley published an anthology of mystical
writings, THE PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY, in which he argued that while mystics
from the Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Sufi traditions conceived of God
differently, their experiences of union with the godhead, or what Huxley
termed the Divine Ground, and the insights they derived from this, were
essentially the same. For Huxley, this constituted empirical evidence that
there was a unified metaphysical realm beyond the phenomenal world of
diversity. His experiments with mescaline and LSD were conducted in order
to apprehend this metaphysical dimension for himself. The books THE DOORS
OF PERCEPTION (1954) and HEAVEN AND HELL (1956) record his psychedelic
experiences and the conclusions he drew from them.

Despite Huxley's commitment to mysticism, he never abandoned his faith in
science, and in his later work, such as ISLAND (1962) and LITERATURE AND
SCIENCE (1963), he argued that if we want to realise our 'human
potentialities' we need to embrace both.

Huxley died of throat cancer on the day of John F. Kennedy's assassination,
22 November 1963. His essays have been collected in the Complete Essays (6
vols., 2000-02), edited by James Sexton and Robert S. Baker; and two
separate volumes of his correspondence have been published, edited by
Grover Smith (1969) and James Sexton (2007) respectively.
