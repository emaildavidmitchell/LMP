Leavis, F. R. (1895-1978)
Frank Raymond Leavis was an influential, though controversial, literary
critic and teacher who was raised and educated in Cambridge, England, where
he eventually held a permanent academic position. In 1929, he married a
student, Q. D. (Queenie Dorothy, ne Roth) (1906-81), with whom he engaged
in a lifelong intellectual partnership. Known for his uncompromising
intellectual stances, Leavis built on the tradition of journalism-based
criticism by articulating the role of the academic critic in English. After
taking eight years to produce his first book, New Bearings in English
Poetry (1932), Leavis published prolifically, covering topics in poetry,
the novel, and English education, always seeking to address questions of
the worth and objectives of reading. Leavis dedicated a large part of his
career to interpretations of the work of modernist writers D. H. Lawrence
and T. S. Eliot, of whom he claimed, our time, in literature, may fairly
be called the age of D. H. Lawrence and T. S. Eliot; indeed, Eliots own
critical writings from the 1930s were an important early influence on
Leavis (Storer 54). Leavis had publicly antagonistic relationships with
some scholars, including C. P. Snow; despite his intellectual
combativeness, he is respected as one of the founders of the modern study
of English literature.
