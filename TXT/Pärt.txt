Arvo Prt (1934  )
Ivan Moody

Biography

Arvo Prt is an Estonian composer whose music has had phenomenal success
worldwide since his radical stylistic change from an overtly modernistic
aesthetic to a radically simplified, post-tonal idiom.  Still as a student
under Heino Eller, he caused a sensation in Moscow and Leningrad with the
premire of Nekrolog (1960), the first dodecaphonic work to be written in
Estonia.

In 1962, however, Prt received the first prize in the Competition for
Young Composers held in Moscow for Meie aed (Our Garden, 1959), a tonal
work, and for the oratorio Maailmaa samm (1961).   Between 1958 and 1967,
he worked as an engineer at Estonian Radio, afterwards working in Tallinn
as a freelance composer.  Following the aesthetic reorientation
foreshadowed in Credo (1968) and the Symphony no. 3 (1971), in 1980, he was
allowed to leave with his family for Israel, but instead remained in Vienna
for a year and a half.  He was awarded a DAAD scholarship in 1981-2 which
meant that he could live in West Berlin, where he has retained a residence
ever since.

Prt's vast public success owes much to the series of recordings made by
the German label ECM, beginning with Tabula Rasa in 1984, and with the
subsequent collaboration of the English group the Hilliard Ensemble
(notably the recording of Passio in 1988).  He has also received a number
of academic prizes, from Estonia (1978 and 1989), Austria and Germany (the
Heinrich Strobel Foundation in 1980), Sweden and Switzerland (1983) and
again Austria in 1984.


Style

Prt's first works, the Partita and the two Sonatinas for piano (1958) are,
stylistically, neoclassical, but in the dodecaphonic Nekrolog (1960) he was
already distancing himself from the the serial technique which he had
absorbed from the books by Herbert Eimert and Ernst Kenek.  The work was
dedicated to the victims of fascism, and caused a strongly negative
reaction impression amongst the Soviet press, Prt being specifically
chosen for censure by the First Secretary of the Union of Composers, Tikhon
Khrennikov.

Towards the end of his serial phase, Prt began investigating aleatoricism
and sonorism, though in his earlier serial works sonorism had already been
quite evident.  Thus, in the brief Perpetuum mobile for orchestra (written
in 1963 and dedicated to Luigi Nono), the series grows vertically, above
the cluster from which it is derived.

Prt also explored techniques from earlier music: the title of the Symphony
no. 1 (1964), Polfooniline   Polyphonic   already betrays this
interest, even though its structure is serial.  In Symphony no. 2 (1966),
the work's darkness and brutality are unexpectedly derailed by a quotation
from Tchaikovsky's Album for Children (1878).  The breakdown in vocabulary
apparent in Symphonies nos. 1 and 2 was hastened by the composers
embracing of quotation (increasingly, of baroque music) and collage, as may
be clearly seen in Collage zu B-A-C-H for oboe, harpsichord, piano and
strings (1964) the 'cello concerto Pro et Contra (1966), whose very brief
slow movement is based on a stereotypical lamenting baroque cadential
figure, and finally Credo (1968), which takes the idea of collage to an
extreme, Prt's own music being completely obliterated by that of Bach.

Credo (1968), for piano, mixed choir and orchestra, also caught the
attention of the authorities on account of its spiritual content, but for
the composer it was the end of a road, the end of his first creative
period. There followed a period of almost total silence, interrupted only
by two works, the Symphony no. 3 (1971) and the cantata Laul armastatule
(Song of the Beloved, 1973, revised 1974).   Prt's new stylistic
trajectory provoked enormous surprise in the cultural world of the time,
when many composers had fought for the right to employ avant-garde
procedures.  In addition, the role of religion in his music was
increasingly evident.  The Biblical content of Saara oli heksakmmend-
aastane (When Sarah was 90 years old for soprano, violin, double-bass or
two electric guitars, harpsichord and percussion, 1976) was hidden by the
composer behind the neutral title of Modus.

The composers meeting in 1970 with Andres Mustonen, founder and director
of the early music group Hortus Musicus, led to a period of intense study
of medieval chant and polyphony and renaissance music, which in due course
had its effect on the music he was composing.  It was also during this
period that Prt reorientated himself spiritually, being received into the
Russian Orthodox Church.  All these factors led to the composition of the
Symphony no. 3 in 1971, which employs polyphonic writing according to the
principles of the renaissance music he had been studying, but built on
material derived from Gregorian chant and expressed in Brucknerian
orchestra guise.

After these works, Prt reassessed completely his compositional premises,
finding a new vocabulary that rejected the modern, bases as it was on
triads and the resonance of bells, thus earning the name
tintinnabulation, the technique employed in a long series of works
written around Christian themes after 1976, including Arbos, Fratres,
Cantus in memoriam Benjamin Britten and Tabula Rasa (all 1977), Passio
(1982), Te Deum (1984-5), Stabat Mater (1985), Litany (1994/6) and Kanon
Pokajanen (1997) and a vast number of short a cappella choral compositions.
 More recent works such as the piano concerto Lamentate (2002) and the
Symphony no. 4 (2008) have shown an interest in re-engaging with the
composers past work, the former in particular suggesting a survey of his
compositional life.
