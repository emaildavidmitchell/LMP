Paraskevaídis, Graciela (1940-)

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

Graciela Paraskevaídis is a composer, musicologist and educator who lies between referents of Latin American music production. Born and solidly formed in the city of Buenos Aires, Paraskevaídis has resided in the city of Montevideo, Uruguay, since 1975. Paraskevaídis’ musical and theoretical work has a spacious reception and dissemination in Latin American and international spheres. A powerful and expressive concentrated load characterizes her musical production. Her works often have a restricted set of sound materials and expressive use of silence that are combined with non-mechanical reiteration processes. Paraskevaídis develops an important role as musicologist alongside teaching and composition.

Musical Studies and Career

Paraskevaídis studied at the National Conservatory of Music ‘Carlos López Buchardo’ of Buenos Aires. There, she took lessons in composition and stimulation from Roberto Garcia Morillo. Between 1965 and 1966, she was a fellow of the Latin American Center for Advanced Musical Studies (CLAEM) of the Instituto Torcuato Di Tella. In the CLAEM, thanks to the exchange with colleagues, Paraskevaídis contacted the social reality of Latin American countries and that experience influenced the way of approaching their production aesthetically and socially. Paraskevaídis recognizes composers Iannis Xenakis and Gerardo Gandini as those who promoted his musical thinking while she studied at the CLAEM. Between 1968 and 1971, she studied with Wolfgang Fortner in the School of Music in Freiburg (Germany) with a scholarship from the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service). Also in Germany, in 1984 she lived in Berlin as a guest in the Artists in Residence Program and in Stuttgart, 1988, invited by the Akademie Scholss Solitude.



Paraskevaídis is extremely active in coordinating musical associations. Along with other Latin American composers, she organized and coordinated the Latin American Contemporary Music Courses that developed between 1975-1989. She was a founding member of News Music Core of Buenos Aires (Núcleo Música Nueva de Buenos Aires) and Argentinian Society of Contemporary Music. Currently she is a member of New Music Core Montevideo (Núcleo Música Nueva Montevideo) and the Uruguayan Society of Contemporary Music.



Between 1985-92, Paraskevaídis taught at the School of Music in Montevideo. Besides a strong teaching in the private sphere, Paraskevaídis develops a wide work as musicologist. His theoretical production ranges from musical analysis of current and traditional repertoire to historical writings on several Latin American themes. Together with her numerous essays and articles, she is author of the books La obra sinfónica de Eduardo Fabini (1992) and Luis Campodónico, compositor (2000). Among the journals that have published her texts, we can name Musik Texte, Pauta, Revista Musical Chilena, Lulú, World New Music Magazine and Revista Argentina de Musicología. Between 1990 and 2000 she was co-editor of the World New Music Magazine and in 2004 she created and co-edited with Max Nyffeler the website www.latinoamerica-musica.net (dedicated to the dissemination of texts about contemporary Latin American music) where she is presently editor. Paraskevaídis has translated many articles from German and Jean-Jacques Dünki’s book Schönbergs Zeichen: Wege zur Interpretation seiner Klaviermusik (Los signos de Schoenberg, Caracas, Monte Ávila, 2005). In 1994 the Munich Goethe Institute awarded her the Medal Goethe. In 2006 she received the Prize Morosoli (Uruguay).



Production and Characteristics of the Works

Her compositions have received numerous awards (Argentine Association of Composers, City of Buenos Aires and Berlin Academy of Arts, among others) and have been played in several countries in Latin America, North America, Asia and Europe. Aesthetically and ethically, the author is considered herself linked to Edgar Varèse, Silvestre Revueltas and Luigi Nono. Paraskevaídis creates from the artisan work on the possibilities of sound as texture generator rather than using preset structures or abstract systems.



One of the elements that characterize the works of Paraskevaídis is to produce innovative sound effects through relatively conventional resources. Usually, the works are created for small to medium homogeneous set of instruments or voices a cappella. Through the use of clusters and blocks sound in the higher or lower pitches, the author creates a microtonal sound world and the spectral enrichment of sounds performed by the instrument players. The magma series (a total of seven works, the majority for wind instruments); un lado, otro lado (1984), for solo piano and ático (2006), for piccolo and sopranino recorder, are typical examples of the resources described. Another important element is the presence of highly concentrated sound material, economic and exhibited in repetition or recurrence. In turn, the explicit pulse influences creating non-evolutionary formal organization that is sectioned by strong contrasts of intensity, register or silence. These characteristics are in works such as todavía no (1979), for three flutes and three clarinets or libres en el sonido presos en el sonido (1997), for instrumental ensemble. The titles of the works present a stimulant symbolism and many of them come from poems by Juan Gelman. In the last years, Paraskevaídis has done works for members of the Experimental Orchestra of Native Instruments (OEIN, Bolivia) created and directed by Cergio Prudencio.
