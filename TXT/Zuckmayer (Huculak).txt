Carl Zuckmayer



Carl Zuckmayer, author and playwright, was born on December 27, 1896 in Nackenheim, Germany. With the outbreak of war in 1914, he joined a field artillery unit on the Western Front, but by 1917 he had become disillusioned with the conflict and contributed poetry to Franz Pfemfert’s pacifist Die Aktion [The Action]: A Magazine for Liberal Politics and Literature, which billed itself as “an organ for honest radicalism.” Success as a writer eluded Zuckmayer until 1924, when he was appointed playwright at the Deutsches Theater along with Bertolt Brecht. Zuckmayer had his first artistic success with the folk comedy, Der fröhliche Weinberg [The Merry Vineyard] (1925), which won the Weimar Republic’s most prestigious literary award, the Kleist Prize. His greatest early achievements were his collaboration with Josef von Sternberg on the film, Der blaue Engel [The Blue Angel] (1930), and the staging of his satire on militarism, Der Hauptmann von Köpenick [The Captain of Köpenick] (1931). Zuckmayer’s work was banned under the Nazi regime; he moved his family to Austria in 1933, but was prompted to leave for Switzerland in 1938. In 1939, Zuckmayer immigrated to the United States, where he worked briefly for Warner Brothers. In 1946 he wrote Des Teufels General [The Devil’s General], a critical and popular success in post-war Germany. Until he settled in Switzerland in 1958, Zuckmayer split his time between the United States and Europe. His collected works (poetry, fiction, plays, autobiography) have won numerous awards and have been adapted for both film and television. Zuckmayer died on January 18, 1977.
