Nicols Masquiarn Daz

Lawyer,  composer  and  academic.  His  career  was   built   upon   several
achievements in formative, artistic, administrative and extensional  fields,
making him a key figure for understanding the 20th century's Chilean  music.
His influence and relevance are undeniable today, specially by his  role  in
the creation of a musical institucion in his country, place from where  were
draw the guidelines for its art music in the first half of 20th century.

He studied law from 1917 at the Law School, University of  Chile,  graduated
with  a  lawyer  degree  in  1921.  In  parallel  received  instruction   in
composition from Enrique Soro, making his first works in these  years.  Once
his studies finished, between 1922 and 1923, he  traveled  to  Europe  as  a
secretary of the Chilean Embassy in Madrid,  where  he  takes  some  lessons
with Conrado del Campo. On his return he assumes a position in the  Ministry
of Foreign Affairs. Having resumed his public activity in Chile, Santa  Cruz
assumed the leadership of the Bach Society  -chorus  founded  in  1917-  and
reformulated its aims. Through it and thanks to  its  significant  influence
in  social  and  politics,  promotes  a  changeover   in   Chilean   musical
institution.  Their  efforts  succeeded  the  annexation  of  the   National
Conservatory of Music to the University of  Chile  (1928),  with  subsequent
consideration of musician as a university  professional.  The  process  that
settled off then led to the creation of entities  such  as  the  Faculty  of
Arts in  the  University  of  Chile  (1929),  the  National  Association  of
Composers (1935) and  the  National  Symphony  Concerts  Association  (1931-
1938), to name a few.

The climax of his efforts is the foundation  of  the  Institute  of  Musical
Extension (1940), which meant the recognition of musical culture as part  of
the State's  institutions.  This  led  to  the  creation  of  the  Symphonic
Orchestra of Chile, Choir of  the  University  of  Chile,  National  Ballet,
Radio University of Chile and  Chilean  Musical  Review.  Also  through  the
Institute of Musical Extension  are  created  the  Chilean  Music  Festivals
(1947-1969) and the Prizes for Work, the main space for the  performing  and
outreaching of Chilean academic music while they stay active.

Between 1928 and 1953 he gives  the  professorship  of  composition  in  the
Faculty of Arts, University of Chile, where he taught an  entire  generation
of Chilean composers, counting among them  Gustavo  Becerra-Schmidt,  Miguel
Aguilar, Carlos Botto,  Alfonso  Montecino  and  Juan  Orrego  Salas,  among
others. For his academic work, in  1932  he  is  assigned  as  Dean  of  the
Faculty of Arts. In 1944 is appointed as Vice Rector of the  University  and
between 1948 and 1951 exercises as  deputy  Rector.  In  1948  achieved  the
founding of the Faculty of Music Arts and Sciences, of  which  he  was  Dean
from 1962 to 1968. Also took many relevant management positions  in  Chilean
and international institutions: Vice President in the International  Society
for Music Education (1953-1955), member of  the  International  Society  for
Contemporary Music (1954),  President  in  the  International  Committee  of
Music (1956-58) and President in the Chilean Academy  of  Fine  Arts  (1980-
82), among others.

Santa Cruz seems to gravitate in Chilean musical milieu more because of  his
role in the building of an institution than for  his  artwork,  nevertheless
of the recognition he received by him.  We  found  in  Chilean  musicography
many statements such as "the history of the musical  life  of  this  century
Chilean confused with the very life of Santa  Cruz"  (Claro  1973:  164)  or
these that makes  him  part  of  "a  national  creative  tradition  that  is
transmitted through the organic  promotion,  outreaching  and  preservation"
driven by himself and that are part  of  the  creators  as  P.  H.  Allende,
Isamitt, Cotapos,  Soro  and  Leng,  main  references  for  later  composers
(Merino 1979: 16). This categorical presence has promoted a critical  review
from the most recent Chilean musicology.

The institutional model formulated by  Santa  Cruz  favored  some  aesthetic
criteria highly influenced  over  the  profile  of  academic  production  in
Chilean music during the first half  of  the  20th  century.  A  ideological
foundation of racial kind  helped  to  place  a  Germanic  tradition  passed
through J. S. Bach, Beethoven and Wagner as main  references,  and  gathered
its  most   recent   influences   from   Post-Romantic,   Neoclassical   and
Expressionists  -previous  to  twelve-tone   technique-   composers.   These
features are  actually  present  in  his  music,  which  also  includes  the
medieval and Renaissance polyphonic tradition. Becerra and  Leng  had  found
in his music "a tendency to monumentality" (Merino 1979:  23)  that  because
of its variety and complexity  it  enriches  in  the  crossover  of  diverse
factors.  They  also  appear,  at  an   early   stage,   some   nuances   of
Impressionism.

His  creative  life  distinguishes  three  stages:  initiation  (1917-1929),
maturation (1930-52) and  maturity  (1952  onwards).  Except  in  the  first
stage, where we found greater exuberance and a tendency to be guided by  the
emotional, it is possible to establish a  general  characterization  of  his
work.  Santa  Cruz  assigned  to  melody  a  structural  function,  favoring
polyphonic textures and motivic development, with an autonomous  driving  of
melodic lines that don't lose sight of  the  harmonic  outcome.  In  general
terms, he uses a modal setting for harmony that, in the  horizontal  driving
and chromatic movement of voices, can reach sonority close to  Atonality  or
even to Dodecaphony. Frequent in his music are the  gradual  moving  in  the
construction of melodic and rhythmic  cells,  the  motivic  recurrence,  the
resolution of jumps with opposite movement, in the  way  of  16th  century's
polyphony,  and  use  of  irregular  rhythms.  The   thoroughness   of   his
compositional technique is also evident in a  straight  use  of  traditional
structures such as rondo and sonata. Finally, its  analysts  note  a  marked
concern for contrapuntal density than the timbre, leaving  the  instrumental
color as a secondary factor in his compositional style.

Santa Cruz's catalog of works has around eighty scores, many of  them  small
vocal and choral pieces. Among his most important  works  are  Cinco  Poemas
Trgicos (1929), String Quartet No. 1 (1930-31), Cinco Piezas para  Orquesta
de Cuerdas (1937), Variaciones para piano y orquesta (1943), Symphony No.  2
(1948)  gloga  (1949)  and  Preludios  Dramticos  (1946)  for   orchestra,
recognized as the most transcendental work of his  repertoire.  In  1951  he
obtains the National Art Award in Music.
