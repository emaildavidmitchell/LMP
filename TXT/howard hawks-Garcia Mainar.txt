Howard Hawks (1896-1977)
Luis Miguel Garca Mainar (University of Zaragoza)
Born Howard Winchester Hawks in Goshen, Indiana, to a wealthy industrialist
family, he is considered one of the major directors of the classical
Hollywood studio era. He was not a film stylist, but worked within
mainstream studio formulas and avoided spectacular flourishes. Hawks was a
versatile professional who excelled in every major film genre and
contributed to establishing several of them, such as the gangster film with
Scarface (1932), the screwball comedy with Bringing Up Baby (1938), or the
adventure melodrama with Only Angels Have Wings (1939). His status changed
from mere studio director to artist when French critics advocated the
politique des auteurs in the 1950s and 1960s and hailed him, together with
Alfred Hitchcock, as the paradigm of the American auteur. Henri Langlois
considered him the first modernist American director for embracing
functionalism and rejecting impressionism and ornament (1963). To Peter
Wollen, his films had the perfection of well-designed machines. His love of
speed and aviation both confirmed him as the new modern man and revealed
his taste for the values of traditional heroic adventure (1996, 8).
      After graduating in mechanical engineering at Cornell University and
being trained as an Air Force pilot during World War I, he started working
in the film industry as a property man in 1919 for the Mary Pickford
Company, then as a writer from 1923 until he moved to Fox in 1926 as
director of silent films, A Girl in Every Port (1928) being the most
renowned of them. With the arrival of sound he tried his hand at every
genre in pictures contracted for almost every studio of the classical era
until he retired in 1970. His directorial idiosyncrasy was inscribed in
story and dialogue, written by a relatively steady group of collaborators
and friends that included Ben Hecht, Jules Furthman, Leigh Brackett and
William Faulkner. Fast-paced witty lines and character and gender reversal
defined such comedies as Twentieth Century (1934), His Girl Friday (1940),
I Was a Male War Bride (1949) or Monkey Business (1952). Adventure hybrids,
from melodramas to comedies or hard-boiled romance, featured the Hawksian
woman, a mix of feisty and tormented femininity often associated with
Lauren Bacalls Slim in To Have and Have Not (1943). Alongside her,
Humphrey Bogart brought to this film, and to the later The Big Sleep (1946)
the rugged, Hemingwaysque masculinity after which Hawks fashioned himself.
The homosocial world of the male group, structured his adventure films and
Westerns, from Red River (1948) to The Big Sky (1952), Rio Bravo (1959), El
Dorado (1967) and Rio Lobo (1970), his last film.
      In 1953, Jacques Rivettes Gnie de Howard Hawks brought him to the
attention of the Cahier du cinma critics, his name becoming a symbol in
their attempt to elevate popular cinema to the category of art. In the
1960s they were joined in this praise by Andrew Sarris in the United States
and by the Movie magazine critics Victor Perkins, Robin Wood and Peter
Wollen in Great Britain.
