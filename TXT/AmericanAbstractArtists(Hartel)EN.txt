AMERICAN ABSTRACT ARTISTS

The American Abstract Artists is  a  formally  established  organization  of
painters, sculptors, and printmakers that  has  been  devoted  to  promoting
abstraction in the United States since the late-1930s.  .  The  organization
was established in New York City in 1936, at a time when  American  art  was
dominated by figurative, realistic styles such  as  Regionalism  and  Social
Realism, which favoured depicting everyday  life  and  people  and  national
historical subjects.  . It held  several  exhibitions  over  the  subsequent
years, including a large annual exhibition each winter from  1937  to  1941.
. It was most influential in the late-1930s through the  mid-1940s.   .  The
membership grew to more than fifty  artists  at  this  time,  and  its  most
influential, involved, and famous members  have  included  Burgoyne  Diller,
Ilya Bolotowsky, George L. K. Morris, Balcomb Greene,  Albert  E.  Gallatin,
Alexander Calder, Suzy Frelinghuysen, Fernand Lger,  Piet  Mondrian,  Josef
Albers, Jean Hlion, Carl  Holty,  Ad  Rinehardt,  Gertrude  Greene,  Stuart
Davis, Charles Shaw, Vaclav Vytlacil, Jean Xceron, and David Smith.   .  The
American Abstract Artists is  often  thought  to  have  advocated  a  rather
homogenous abstract style that was geometric, linear, and planar,  but  this
is a broad over-simplification of the diversity of its  membership.   .  The
organization became less publically active and militant by the mid-1940s  as
Americas involvement in World War II intensified, the art programs  of  the
New Deal ended, and the rise of Abstract  Expressionism  made  advocacy  for
abstraction less necessary.  . However, it still exists,  is  based  in  New
York City, organizes exhibitions, and has published a  journal  since  1996.
. New members are still accepted, but membership is by nomination only.
