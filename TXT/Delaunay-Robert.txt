Robert Delaunay (12 April 1885, Paris  25 October 1941, Montpellier)


                              In this movement of colors I find the essence,
                  which does not arise from a system, or an a priori theory.
    (part of a letter written to August Macke (Expressionist painter), 1912)


Robert-Victor-Flix Delaunay was one of the precursors of abstract  painting
in Europe. He played a  critical  role  in  establishing  abstract  painting
before the First  World  War  and  had  a  strong  influence  on  the  later
development of abstract art. Delaunay became a representative of Orphism,  a
term coined by Guillaume Apollinaire in reference to Orpheus, the  legendary
musician and poet in Greek mythology. Delaunay wrote many letters  to  other
artists like August Macke, Franz Mark and Wassily  Kandinsky,  which  reveal
that his main concerns were related to  the  luminous  essence  and  to  the
movement of colors in nature.

Robert Delaunay was the son of  George  Delaunay  and  the  countess  Berthe
Flicie de Rose. During his childhood his parents got divorced  and  he  was
raised by his mothers sister, Marie, and her husband Charles Damour  in  La
Rouchre. In 1902 he started studying in the Rosins atelier for  decorative
arts in Belleville. The following year he left  Rosins  to  focus  only  on
painting and in 1904 he exhibited  some  of  his  works  in  the  Salon  des
Indpendants. These first works were strongly influenced  by  Impressionism.
Between 1905 and 1907 Delaunay began studying the  color  theory  of  Michel
Eugne Chevreul. His works of this period were strongly influenced  by  Neo-
Impressionism, particularly the works of Paul Czanne. In 1907 he served  as
regimental librarian for the Military Forces in Laon.
      After one year of military service, Delaunay returned to Paris and got
in contact with Cubist painters. He participated in early  Cubism,  but  was
mainly interested in introducing chromatic  and  abstract  experiments  into
the cubist geometric aesthetics. He then developed his series of the  Eiffel
Tower, a series of works that contains  a  more  personal  chromatic  cubist
style,  which  was  later  labeled   Orphism   by   Guillaume   Apollinaire.
Apollinaire  associated  the  rhythmic  possibilities  of  colors  made   by
Delaunay with the abstract harmony of music.  In  1910  Robert  married  the
Russian painter Sonia  Terk,  with  whom  he  shared  the  interest  in  the
harmonic, rhythmic and emotional effects of  color  in  painting.  One  year
later their son, Charles, was born.
      In 1911 Robert met Wassily Kandinsky, who invited him  to  participate
in  the  first  exhibition  of  Der  Blaue  Reiter,  a   German   group   of
expressionist  painters.  The  following  year  he  had   his   first   solo
exhibitions in Paris and Zurich. From then on his work became more and  more
abstract. Delaunay came to believe that light could  be  expressed  as  pure
color independent of any objective content. In 1913 he  began  the  Circular
Forms, a  series  of  paintings  that  consist  of  colored  discs  with  no
reference to any kind of  object,  in  which  color  contrasts  created  the
structure of the picture.
      Between 1914 and 1920 due to the outbreak  of  the  First  World  War,
Robert and Sonia Delaunay lived in Portugal and Spain, where they  discussed
artistic partnerships with different  artists.  In  1920  they  returned  to
Paris, Robert continued to  work  in  an  abstract  style  and  in  1937  he
directed the decoration of the Aeronautics and Railway Pavilions  at  Paris
World Exhibition. His last major works, mostly vertical and diagonal  stacks
of disks and haloes of color  joined  in  a  rhythmical  design,  are  often
entitled Rhythm without End.
      Delaunay died of cancer in 1941 in Montpellier at the age of  56.  His
body was reburied in 1952 in Gambais.
