Schiaparelli, Elsa (1890-1973)
Elsa Luisa Maria Schiaparelli was an avantgarde fashion designer extremely
influential in the 1930s. Born in Rome into a well-to-do family, an early
msalliance with William de Wendt de Kerlo forced her to live in poverty in
London and New York until she moved to Paris where she met avantgarde
artists and  without ever having learned to sew - began her career in
fashion. In contrast to Coco Chanels modernist simplicity, Schiaparelli
indulged in aesthetic exaggerations and a profusion of fantastic
decorations like luxurious embroideries (realized by Franois Lesage [1929-
2011]), often inspired by surrealist art. She transformed Salvador Dals
paintings into a dress with drawers; a printed silk Tears Dress (part of
her 1938 Circus collection; http://bit.ly/NxF0Oq) is considered a
precursor of twentieth century punk styles. Schiaparelli loved trompe-lil-
effects; her careers starting point was a black knitted sweater with a
trompe-lil white bow (1927). A hat looked like a ladys shoe turned
upside down; a glove wore painted finger nails. Schiaparelli designed
theatrical fashion jewellery and devised vibrant new colors like shocking
pink. In 1937, she presented  her perfume Shocking in a provocative
flacon formed by surrealist artist Leonor Fini (1907-1996) as female torso
inspired by actress Mae Wests curvaceuous body. Schiaparelli walked the
tightrope between art and consumerism. The combination of impeccably modern
cuts inspired by architectural principles with striking decorative elements
defines Schiaparellis modernity. Her fashion house closed down in 1954
when her witty and fantastic style was no longer to date; that year, she
also published her memoir Shocking Life.
