Scharoun was born on Sept. 20th 1893 in Bremen and  raised  in  Bremerhaven.
His architectural studies in  Berlin  were  interrupted  by  WW  I  and  not
resumed. His building activity before  WWII  covers  East  Prussia,  Wroclaw
(Breslau) and Berlin, after  1945  West-Germany  with  West-Berlin.  In  the
revolutionary atmosphere after WWI Scharoun became a member  of  the  short-
lived EXPRESSIONIST group  Glserne  Kette  [Glass  Chain]  in  1919.  Being
member of the architectural association Der Ring [The Ring]  which  promoted
NEUES BAUEN [New Building] since 1926,  he  was  engaged  with  private  and
public housing projects until 1933.  Afterwards  Scharoun  was  confined  to
private residential comissions until the  outbreak  of  WW  II.  The  Soviet
military government made him city architect  of  Berlin  in  1945-46,  after
which he accepted  a  professorship  at  the  Technical  University  Berlin.
Scharouns rich later  building  career  began  in  the  mid-1950s  and  was
interrupted by his death on Nov. 25th 1972 in Berlin.

Around 1920, when  Scharoun  produced  many  drawings  and  watercolours  of
dynamicly formed buildings of utopian character and the competition  project
for the Hygiene Museum in  Dresden  (1920),  he  was  part  of  the  general
Expressionist trend in Germany. The crystalline forms of the museum  and  of
several sketches reflect his relation  to  the  group  Glserne  Kette.  The
designs  of  the  competition  entries  for  an  office  building   in   the
Friedrichstrasse, Berlin, and for the stock-exchange  in  Knigsberg  (1921-
22) tend more strongly to  organic  shapes.  They  display  a  vertical  and
horizontal dynamism, thus expressing the circulation within  the  buildings.
This is due to Scharouns  relation  to  Hugo  Hrings  ideas  of  organic
building  and  of  an  organic  functionalism,  according  to  which  the
building, understood like a second skin or organ, is developed from  inwards
to outwards while being reluctant to use of right angles.

The years 1926-33 are known as the white period and show  the  inspiration
of nautical motifs. Despite  the  motifs  being  a  common  feature  of  the
machine aesthetics and modern housing design of the 1920s, they  might  also
be traced back, in Scharouns case, to his youth in Bremerhaven. Due to  the
trend of the Neues Bauen his designs became  more  objective,  nonetheless
Scharoun preserved an expressive language. Several  housing  projects  prove
his interest in the  creation  of  homogeneous  dwelling-cells  and  in  the
mediation between individual and  community.  The  Hostel  for  Singles  and
Newly Married Couples at the Werkbund exhibition in  Breslau  (now  Wroclaw,
Poland; 1928-29) and two single-family houses, at the Weissenhof  exhibition
Die Wohnung (The Dwelling) and in Lbau, Saxony (1927/1933), stand out.

In contrast to  many  German  avant-garde  architects,  Scharoun  stayed  in
Germany during the Nazi period, when he realized  20  single-family  houses,
such as the house Baensch in Berlin (1934-35), with an  inconspicuous  front
but an inner progressive concept  of  organic  building  with  overlapping
dwelling processes and a middle room for  community  life.  In  the  years
1939-45 Scharoun did not built but returned to his Expressionist  beginnings
with around 100 drawings of architectural visions.

In the decades after 1945  Scharoun  preserved  his  Expressionist,  dynamic
anti-cubic style in projects and realised commissions of schools,  theatres,
mass housing and other  public  engagements,  thus  mediating  some  of  the
Expressionist heritage from the pre-war to the  post-war  era.  His  middle
room-concept, developed in the 1930s, persisted as well and  was  converted
in his outstanding Berlin Philarmonic (1956-63) into the concept  music  in
the centre.
