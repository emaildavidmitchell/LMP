Modernist Music in Turkey

Ali Cenk Gedik

Modernist music in Turkey owes  its  foundations  to  the  late  bourgeoisie
revolution in 1923. Young republic, motivated by the target  of  building  a
modern nation-state, rejects the traditional Ottoman art music  and  aim  at
synthesising Turkish folk music and  western  classical  music,  known  as
Music Revolution. Therefore, the  first  generation  of  modern  composers
Cemal Reit Rey (1904-1972),  Hasan  Ferid  Alnar  (1906-1978),  Ulvi  Cemal
Erkin (1906-1972), Ahmet Adnan Saygun  (1907-1991)  and  Necil  Kazm  Akses
(1908-1999)  called  as  Turkish  Five,  come  out  among  young  talented
musicians sent to European conservatories such  as  Paris,  Berlin,  Vienna,
Budapest and Prague for this task. The second generation of composers,  such
as Blent Arel (1919-1990), lhan  Usmanba  (1921--)  and  lhan  Mimarolu
(1926-2012) follow a different path by appreciating the most  recent  trends
in modernist music ranging from serial to electronic music. While a  similar
trend survives by the next generations of composers,  each  generation  also
includes composers appreciating the traditional Ottoman art  music  and  the
Turkish folk music. Finally, it is a common agreement today that the  Music
Revolution has failed despite the worldwide known composers  aforementioned
due  to  the  musical  policies  of  right-wing  governments   against   the
bourgeoisie revolution.

The fail of Music Revolution is closely related with  late  modernisation,
a process operated by the state where the rulers act with the  knowledge  of
past  modernisation  processes  in  Europe  (ulhaolu   2002).   Therefore,
westernization  and  nationalization  of  cultural  life  not  only   shaped
modernist music but a whole musical culture in  Turkey  (Gedik  and  Bozkurt
2009). Invention of Turkish folk music and  the  appreciation  of  western
classical music are in accordance  with  the  sociopolitical  ideal  of  the
rulers: Construction of a modern Turkish society. It should  be  noted  also
that first appereances of late modernisation was also existed  in  the  last
period of Ottoman Empire.

Besides the  education  of  composers  in  Europe,  first  conservatory  and
orchestra of western classical music are  build,  and  recordings  from  all
periods of the genre are broadcasted by the state radio. The most  prominent
figures of modernist music such as Hindemith, Bartok and Schostakovich  also
contribute to the revolution in varying degrees and  in  various  issues  by
visiting Turkey. Distinguished  performers  such  as  soprano  Leyla  Gencer
(1928-2008), violinist Suna Kan (1936--), pianists dil Biret  (1941--)  and
Pekinel sisters (1953) and conductor Grer Aykal (1942--) can be said to  be
the result of these musical institutions.

As a result, it is hard to say that any generation of composers  constituted
a musical school except the  attempts  of  Kemal  lerici  (1910-1986)  whom
wrote a theory for the harmonization of traditional Turkish musics  (Oransay
1993). Although foremost modernist composers such as  Kamran  nce  (1960--)
and Aydn Esen (1962--) are still emerging, the government of islamic  party
tried to liquidate  all  modern  musical  institutions  in  last  decade  of
Turkey. On the other hand, the resistance of outstanding modernist  composer
and pianist Fazl Say (1970--) faced with official cencorship and charge  in
2012 and 2003, respectively.
