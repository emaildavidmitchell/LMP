Stella, Joseph (18771946)

An Italian-born American artist, Joseph Stella contributed to the
adaptation of Futurism in the United States and to the advent of
Precisionism. After immigrating to New York City from Naples in 1896, he
studied at the Art Students League and the New York Art School. From 1909
until 1912, Stella resided in Europe, where his exposure to avant-garde
movements, especially Italian Futurism, influenced his subsequent
depictions of machine-age America. Between 1913 and the early 1920s, Stella
developed a personal painting style characterized by abstracted forms,
vivid colors, and vertiginous perspectives of urban and industrial
architecture. In several compositions featuring the Brooklyn Bridge in
particular, Stella evoked the dynamism and immensity of New York with
kaleidoscopic divisions of space and crisscrossing webs of lines. Botanical
and figural subjects, often with religious associations and references to
the tradition of Italian art, dominated the second half of his career.
Perpetually restless, Stella visited Italy repeatedly in the 1920s and
lived in Paris in the early 1930s. Several years of illness preceded his
heart failure in 1946.
