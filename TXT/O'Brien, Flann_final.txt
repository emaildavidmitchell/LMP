OBrien, Flann (1911-1966)

Born Brian ONolan (or  Nuallin) in Strabane, County Tyrone, the novelist
and satirist known as Flann OBrien is now recognized as a leading figure
of Irish MODERNISM alongside JAMES JOYCE and SAMUEL BECKETT. Like JOYCE and
BECKETT, he is also considered to be an important transitional figure to
POSTMODERNISM. His experimental novels, particularly At Swim-Two-Birds
(1939) and The Third Policeman (1967), employ many of the techniques later
identified as postmodern, including the use of parody and pastiche,
recycling of genres and characters, combining of high and low cultural
forms, and so on. Though his acclaim as a novelist was hard won and late in
coming, OBrien enjoyed significant local fame as a journalist for his
Cruiskeen Lawn column, which ran in the Irish Times from 1940 to 1960 under
the pseudonym Myles na gCopaleen (also na Gopaleen, Myles of the Ponies).
      OBriens family moved to Dublin in 1922. In 1929 OBrien enrolled at
JOYCEs alma mater, University College Dublin, where he became a leading
figure in the Literary and Historical Society. It was during this period
that he began to introduce some of his many pseudonyms, including Brother
Barnabas and parodies of WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS and JOHN MILLINGTON SYNGE
(Lionel Prune and Samuel Hall, respectively) in the UCD student magazine
Comhthrom Finne and a satirical magazine called Blather, published in 1934
with his brother and Niall Sherdian. He submitted his MA thesis on Nature
in Irish Poetry in 1935 and the same year entered the Irish Civil Service,
where he worked in the Department of Local Government until an early
retirement in 1953.
      His first novel, At Swim-Two-Birds, was published in 1939 to poor
sales. When the remaining copies were destroyed by a Luftwaffe bomb in
1940, the book disappeared from public view for nearly two decades. At
Swims narrator, a lazy UCD student who lives with his uncle, is writing a
novel about Dermot Trellis, who is also writing a novel. At the end of a
long and complicated journey, Trellis is murdered by a hostile cast of
characters he has pillaged from Irish folklore, cowboy novels, and other
genres. The Third Policeman, OBriens second completed novel, is a
hallucinatory, darkly humorous metaphysical murder mystery, in which the
unnamed narrator tries to make sense of a hellish landscape  Hell itself,
as it turns out  populated by policemen and bicycles and governed by a
strange form of atomic theory. The narrator is also an amateur scholar of
a philosopher and scientist named de Selby, whose (absurd) writings are
discussed at length in the footnotes. Completed in 1940, The Third
Policeman failed to find a publisher until a year after the authors death.
Both of these novels, or anti-novels, challenge and undermine novelistic
conventions on every page.
      It was in 1940 that OBrien, as Myles na gCopaleen, began writing his
Cruiskeen Lawn column. With the exception of the Irish-language novel An
Bal Bocht (1941), he gave up novel writing for the next two decades, until
after the successful reissue of At Swim-Two-Birds in 1960. At this point
his career as a novelist revived briefly with the publication of The Hard
Life: An Exegesis of Squalor (1961), a satire on Catholic Ireland more in
the style of Myles na gCopaleen, and The Dalkey Archive (1964), which
borrows passages from the manuscript of The Third Policeman and includes a
character named JAMES JOYCE. The original text of The Third Policeman was
finally published in 1967, and an English translation of An Bal Bocht as
The Poor Mouth appeared in 1973. In 1954 OBrien secured another footnote
to history by organizing, with John Ryan, Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin,
Tom Joyce (JAMES JOYCEs cousin), and A.J. Leventhal, the first Bloomsday
anniversary pilgrimage.
