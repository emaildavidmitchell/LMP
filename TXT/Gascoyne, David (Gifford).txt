Gascoyne, David (1916-2001)

David Gascoyne was a British poet and novelist active in English SURREALISM
and post-Surrealism. His novel Opening Day (1933) was one of the earliest
prose surrealist works in English, and he actively translated the Parisian
surrealists across the 1930s, partnering with and then replacing SAMUEL
BECKETT in this capacity. Gascoynes A Short Introduction to Surrealism
(1935) is one of the pivotal introductions of Surrealism to English
literature. He joined the COMMUNIST PARTY in 1936 and went to Spain that
year during the SPANISH CIVIL WAR but was disillusioned. He grew closer to
LAWRENCE DURRELL and HENRY MILLER in Paris, adopted much of Millers
anarchist revision to Surrealism, and identified deeply with Durrells The
Black Book (1938). His poetry from this point moved increasingly to
religious and existential materials immediately prior to WORLD WAR II, and
with HERBERT READ, he was among the first English writers to respond to
EXISTENTIALISM. He suffered a breakdown in 1964 and largely stopped
writing. He later resumed friendships with Durrell and ROBERT DUNCAN,
visiting both in the 1980s. Gascoynes homosexuality also left him
alienated, having brief relationships while attached to female literary
influences, including ANTONIA WHITE, ANAIS NIN, and KATHLEEN RAINE. In 1975
he married Judy Lewis, whom he met in Whitecroft Hospital.
