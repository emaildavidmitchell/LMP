Adams, Ansel Easton (1902-1984)  					Word count: 203



Ansel Adams is known for technically precise, large format photographs of the American Western landscape. Self-taught, his father gave him a camera on a 1916 family trip to Yosemite National Park. One year later, he joined the Sierra Club. His life-long environmental activism led to Yosemite’s federal protection. Adams took one of his most famous photographs Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico in 1941 while photographing National Parks for the Department of the Interior. Adams’s early solo exhibitions include the Smithsonian Institution (1931), followed by a 1936 exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz’s New York gallery An American Place. Co-founder of f/64, a group dedicated to ‘straight photography,’ which eschewed manipulation in favor of objectivity, Adams established the Zone System, a method of teaching photographic exposure for precise tonal range, authored articles and guides, including Making a Photograph (1935), and co-founded Aperture in 1952. Creator of the photography department at the California School of Fine Arts and co-founder of the Center for Creative Photography, Adams was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1980 and died in Monterrey, CA, in 1984.
