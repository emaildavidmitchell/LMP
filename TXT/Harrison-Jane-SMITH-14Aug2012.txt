Harrison, Jane (1850-1928)
Jane Ellen Harrison was a classicist credited with being the first woman to
obtain a post in England as a career academic (Beard 2009). Her
scholarship combined archaeological research with mythology to understand
the religious rituals and social practices represented in the art and
literature of ancient Greece. Born in Yorkshire, Harrison was among the
first students to attend Cambridge Universitys newly created school for
women, Newnham College. She later studied with Charles Newton (1816-1894)
in the Department of Antiquities of the British Museum and began a career
as a speaker on archaeology and classical art before her appointment to
Newnham as a lecturer in 1898. Her frequent travels to Greece, as well as
friendships and correspondences with classicists Gilbert Murray (1866-
1957), F. M. Cornford (1874-1943) and other Cambridge Ritualists, prepared
Harrison for her two most well-known books, Prolegomena To The Study Of
Greek Religion (1903) and A Study Of The Social Origins Of Greek Religion
(1912). Both received widespread acclaim and criticism and remain in print
today. Associations with Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group
significantly shaped her influence on the literary culture of twentieth-
century England, where she was considered an outspoken and controversial
figure. The American poet Charles Olson (1910-1970) advocated for
Harrisons research in ancient culture and promoted the psychological and
anthropological readings of antiquity she helped establish as an example
for his own historical-poetic investigations of place.
