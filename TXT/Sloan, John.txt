Sloan, John (1871-1951)

Painter, etcher, and illustrator John Sloan was a leading figure in the
Ashcan School, a group of turn-of-the-century urban realists who used dark
palettes and heavy brushwork to paint the grittier side of New York life.
In 1892, while working as an illustrator at the Philadelphia Inquirer,
Sloan enrolled in evening classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine
Arts and co-founded the Charcoal Club, a group of local artists who met for
informal discussions and sketching sessions in Robert Henris studio. Sloan
followed Henri to New York City, where he became associated with The
Eight. Later in his career Sloan painted nudes and portraits as well as
city scenes and landscapes in the art colonies of Gloucester,
Massachusetts, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. While he struggled through much of
his career to gain patrons for his work, Sloans New York scenes are now
considered among the most important in American art. In 1939 a book of
Sloans theories was compiled by his student Helen Farr, titled Gist of
Art. Farr was responsible for the preservation and promotion of Sloans
works and archive after his death in 1952.
