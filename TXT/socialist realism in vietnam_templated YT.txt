Socialist Realism in Visual Art, Vietnam

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

Socialist Realism was the dominant style in the visual arts of North Vietnam, from 1945 to the early 1980s. The style was widely promoted following the 1945 revolution through the writing of Truong Chinh (1907-1988), a senior Vietnamese Communist Party member and leading theoretician. Socialist Realism in Vietnamese visual art is characterised by its easily-legible, realist style, optimistic tone, and generally limited range of subject matter: portraits of Ho Chi Minh, scenes of industrial and rural work, soldiers, and historical events associated with Vietnam’s revolutionary development. While Socialist Realism in Vietnam was influenced by art from other Socialist states, the style was also adapted to local aesthetics, especially the artistic foundations of the École des Beaux Arts de l’Indochine (1925-1945), and influences from popular painting and printmaking. Socialist Realism in Vietnam retained several elements of colonial-period art, such as the techniques of silk and lacquer painting, and the influence of Impressionistic oil painting. Decades of war in Vietnam also affected the development of Socialist Realism, as many artists had to work primarily on producing ephemeral propaganda materials. Socialist Realism retained its primacy in North Vietnamese art until the 1980s.

Beginnings in the First Indochina War, 1945-1954 

Although interest in Socialist Realism in Vietnam predates the revolution, the style had no substantial influence on the visual arts until after 1945. During the First Indochina War (1946-1954), the Vietnamese Communist Party’s ideological position on culture was set by the Party theorist and political leader Truong Chinh, through writings like the Theses on Culture (1943) and Marxism and Vietnamese Culture (1948). Influenced by Mao Zedong, Truong Chinh argued that Vietnamese art should be targeted to workers, peasants and soldiers, and should promote the development of a Socialist society. He specified Socialist Realism as the preferred style in the arts, and vigorously rejected Modernist formal experimentation. However, not all artists received the Party’s framework uncritically: for example, the painter To Ngoc Van (1906-1954) published some articles arguing for greater artistic freedom in the late 1940s.



During the war, many artists joined the Viet Minh resistance movement against France, and moved into the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam. The works they produced there can be considered the first phase of Socialist Realism in Vietnamese art. However, due to the extreme material shortages caused by the war, most artists were unable to produce major artworks during this period. Instead, they sketched the activities of farmers and soldiers, and made prints promoting various political campaigns. Stylistic and technical developments in the arts were minimal, although a studio for revolutionary lacquer painting was briefly established by To Ngoc Van and Nguyen Thu Nghiem (b.1919).



Institutionalisation and the Second Indochina War (1954-1976)

Once peace was restored in 1954, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) began to establish new cultural institutions. The use of Socialist Realist style was strongly tied to the state-based system of art production and display. From 1957, visual artists were organised into an Artist’s Association (Hoi My Thuat). Without a private art market, artists made their living through a stipend paid through the Association. The Association was also the main channel for the organisation of art exhibitions, thus exercised a strong influence over artistic production. The post-war period also brought more contact between artists from Vietnam and other Socialist countries. Vietnamese artists were sent overseas to study or exhibit their work in the Socialist countries, and in the early 1960s, teachers from the Soviet Union came to teach at the University of Fine Arts, Hanoi. However, despite this increase in international contacts, there was also a deliberate emphasis on retaining national character in the visual arts. 



Improved material conditions after 1954 meant that artists were now able to develop large-scale works of Socialist Realism. Some artists conducted further research into lacquer, creating large lacquer paintings on themes such as wartime victories, Vietnamese history, and idealised images of workers and farmers. A significant example is the large 1957 painting Xo Viet Nghe Tinh (Nghe Tinh Soviets), representing an anti-colonial movement of the 1920s, which was collaboratively painted in lacquer by six prominent Vietnamese artists, from a sketch by Nguyen Duc Nung (1909-1983). Certain artists – such as Nguyen Sang and Nguyen Tu Nghiem – managed to combine their personal, Modernist-inflected styles with the requirements of Socialist Realism, although the results were sometimes criticised. By contrast, an example of a critically-acclaimed work from the period is the gouache painting Gap Go (Meeting), by Mai Van Hien, which was appreciated for its positive tone, simple style, bright colour and message of cooperation between soldiers and civilians. Painting on silk continued to be practiced, using the techniques developed at the EBAI, but capturing the lives of workers, farmers and soldiers, for instance in the works of Nguyen Thu (b.1930) and Vu Giang Huong (1930-2011).. Large-scale public monumental sculpture also appeared after 1954, and the sculptors Nguyen Hai (1933-2012), Diep Minh Chau (1919-2002) and Le Cong Thanh (b.1932) were especially well-known for their work on sculptures with revolutionary subject matter.



As the activity of the Second Indochina war increased in the mid-1960s, artists were less able to devote themselves fully to art, as many had to serve as soldiers or factory workers. The government began to devote most of its cultural resources to the production of propaganda materials. Poster production began on a larger scale in the late 1960s, with studios set up in the area around Hanoi. The aesthetics of Vietnamese propaganda posters had several different influences and sources: the painterly sensibility of the EBAI, the influence of local folk printing aesthetics, and a bolder, high-contrast, graphic style which was associated with the younger generation of artists who had returned from study in other Socialist countries.



1975-1986 Waning Influence of Socialist Realism

Following the end of the Second Indochina War and the reunification of Vietnam in 1975, Socialist Realism became the official style for the whole of Vietnam. Many large-scale works were made in this period, commemorating the war in a heroic and Realist mode. Artworks were also developed on the themes of economic development and industrialisation, shifting the emphasis from the rural and agricultural themes of previous decades. From the early 1980s, however, artists increasingly began to contest the rigidity and primacy of Socialist Realist style, even within institutional contexts. This anticipated the official shift in government policy from 1986 through the policies of Doi Moi (Renovation). In the years following Doi Moi, most artists moved away from Socialist Realism towards wide-ranging experimentation with different styles and practices. The principal area in which Socialist Realist aesthetics persist in Vietnam is in the public posters and promotional materials for government social campaigns. Socialist Realist poster art from the wartime period also has a popular second life as souvenirs for the tourist market.
