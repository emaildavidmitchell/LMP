Guangdong Modern Dance Company 广东现代舞团 

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

												The Guangdong Modern Dance Company (GMDC) is China’s first professional modern dance performance group. GMDC was founded in 1992 as the ‘Guangdong Experimental Modern Dance Company’ under the leadership of founding director Yang Meiqi (杨美琦) and artistic director Willy Tsao (曹诚渊), and with approval from the provincial government of Guangdong, China. GMDC received early support from American Dance Festival chairman Charles Reinhart and the Asian Cultural Council. Exchange programs facilitated by these groups in the United States were instrumental to the institution of modern dance in China after the 1980s. GMDC’s past artistic directors include Willy Tsao (1992-1998 and 2004-2007), Yang Meiqi (1998-2000), Gao Chengming (高成明, 2000-2004), and Pun Siu-fai (潘少辉, 2007-2012). Together with the modern dance program established by Yang Meiqi at the Guangdong Dance School (joint with the Beijing Dance Academy), GMDC has cultivated the core artistic base for modern dance in China and has helped establish Chinese modern dance on the international stage. Beijing Dance Academy, Beijing Dance LDTX, Hong Kong City Contemporary Dance Company, Jin Xing Dance Theatre of Shanghai, and TAO Body Theatre all draw leading modern dance artists from the early Guangdong school. Each summer, GMDC hosts China’s most important modern dance festival and summer camp, attracting students and teachers from around China and the world.

Early Development 

Several important developments in Chinese modern dance helped make possible the founding of GMDC in 1992. First, Willy Tsao founded the City Contemporary Dance Company in Hong Kong in 1979, with the goal of promoting modern dance in China. In 1985, Yang Meiqi became principal of the Guangdong Dance School, and in 1986 she received a scholarship from the Asian Cultural Council (ACC) to attend the American Modern Dance Festival (ADF) in Durham, North Carolina. After attending ADF, Yang proposed a four-year modern dance curriculum for the Guangdong Dance School and asked Charles Reinhart to provide teachers from the United States to teach at the program. In 1987, the Experimental Course in Modern Dance was established at Guangdong Dance School, with connections to ADF through the Institutional Linkage Program. Willy Tsao, Sarah Stackhouse, Ruby Shang, Douglas Nielson, and Lynda Davis were among the early teachers in the program. In 1988, Jin Xing 金星 was selected from the first class of students to study in the United States, and Wang Mei 王玫, also in first group of students, created the work Tides. In 1988-90, the Guangdong Dance School group performed in Beijing, generating attention and acclaim among the Chinese dance community.  Works included City Romance by Willy Tsao and Basket and Bamboo, a collective creation under direction of Lynda Davis. In 1990, students in the Guangdong course Qin Liming 秦立明 and Qiao Yang 乔杨 won the gold medal in pas de deux at the Fourth Paris International Modern Dance Competition, performing Willy Tsao’s Passing Voice and Impression of Taiji. In 1991, the Guangdong group was invited to perform at the American Dance Festival.

Later Development

After its official founding in 1992, the GMDC became the most important modern dance company in Mainland China. The Company continued to cultivate star performers and choreographers who gained recognition for Chinese modern dance on the international stage.  In 1994 company member Xing Liang (邢亮) won the gold medal in male modern solo at the 6th Paris International Dance Competition. In 1996 company member Sang Jijia (桑吉加) won the gold medal in male modern solo at the 6th Paris International Dance Competition. In 2000, Liu Qi’s (刘琦) work Pagoda won Grand Prize in the Moscow International Arts Competition. GMDC performed at the American Dance Festival for the second time in 1997, and in 2000 GMDC former member Shen Wei (沈伟) established his own critically acclaimed independent modern dance company Shen Wei Dance Arts in New York City. In 2004, the Guangdong Modern Dance Festival was established, and it became the most important modern dance festival in China. After 2004, China’s cultural industry structural reforms terminated full state subvention and government administration for GMDC. GMDC became a joint venture between Xinghai Performing Arts Development Co., Ltd. of Guangdong, and the City Contemporary Dance Company of Hong Kong.
