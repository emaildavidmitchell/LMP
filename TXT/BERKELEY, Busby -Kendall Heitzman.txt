BERKELEY, Busby (29 November 1895- 14 March 1976)

Busby Berkeley was an American film choreographer.  Berkeley is widely
considered to be the first musical director to conceive of musicals as a
filmic spectacle, and not simply a stage production transferred to the
screen.  He employed crane shots, dynamic editing, and elaborate
choreography involving chorus girls arranged in geometric designs.  At the
same time, Berkeley staged his musical numbers on large sound stages and
often incorporated giant and unusual props and swimming pools.  His most
famous sequences include numbers from a trio of Warner Bros. films he
worked on in 1933: Were in the Money and Remember My Forgotten Man
from Gold Diggers of 1933, By a Waterfall from Footlight Parade, and the
title song from 42nd Street.  Berkeley turned to directing and met Esther
Williams on the set of his Take Me Out to the Ballgame (1949).  He would
stage water spectacles for her in Million Dollar Mermaid (1952) and Easy to
Love (1953).  Martin Rubin sees in Berkeleys spectacles a direct
descendant of the superabundance of American three-ring circuses, in
which more action occurs than any one viewer can absorb.  Other critics
have noted the relationship of Berkeleys patterns to Leni Riefenstahls
Nazi documentary films; both utilize what Siegfried Kracauer called the
mass ornament: the image of multiple bodies used to construct a visually
reassuring, but ultimately dehumanized, whole.
