The League of Nations (1919-1946) was an intergovernmental organization formed after WWI to mediate disputes among its member nations through diplomacy and collective security.

The League of Nations (1919-1946) was an intergovernmental organization formed after WWI to mediate disputes among its member nations through diplomacy and collective security. The League was promoted by President Woodrow Wilson, who saw it as a way to ameliorate future national conflicts as his “Fourteen Points” argued for the creation of new (or newly reborn) nations after the collapse of the Austrian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires. Despite Wilson’s involvement, the United States Congress never ratified joining the organization, primarily because it allowed a non-US entity to call American troops into battle. The Congress’s Republican-led rejection is often cited as a key factor in the League’s failure. By the outbreak of WWII, a general lack of confidence in the organization had made it obsolete, leading to its dissolution in 1946. Despite its failures, the organization was the most significant result of a movement toward political internationalism which had begun well before 1914. The League’s post-war effort at internationalism, an ideal espoused earlier in the nineteenth-century by Auguste Comte and again later by Émile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss in France, as well as by J. A. Hobson in England, was undermined from the start by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The League was, however, a predecessor to the United Nations, established in the immediate wake of WWII.
