Owen, Wilfred (1893-1918)

World War (1914-1918). His style can best be described as elegiac or
tragic, standing defiantly against the idealized or propagandistic
depictions of the battlefield prevalent during the Great Wars early
stages. In opposition to the sentiments of Rupert Brooke (1887-1915) and
Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936), and more akin to those of Isaac Rosenberg
(1890-1918) and Siegfried Sassoon (1886-1967), Owen considered such
reductive glorifications of mass slaughter ignorant, if not outright
dishonesta radical viewpoint at the time (Hibberd 222). His influences
range Dante and Shakespeare to Gray, Collins, Shelley, Coleridge, Burns,
Tennyson, the Brownings, and especially Keats. Owens poetic signature and
chief innovation was his subversion of traditional rhyme schemes; Owen
experimented with consonantal end-rhyme (or pararhyme), a technique
healong with Edmund Blunden (18961974)helped popularize (Day-Lewis 25).
Critic Sasi Bhusan Das interprets Owens use of this technique, used in
conjunction with broken rhythms, as an effort to capture the disharmony of
the [Great] War (13).
      Born on March 18, 1893 in Oswestry, Shropshire, England to Harriet
Susan Shaw (1867-1942) and Thomas Owen (1862-1931), Wilfred Owen was raised
in an Evangelical Christian household. Owen passed the matriculation exam
for the University of London in 1911, the same year in which he served as a
pupil and lay assistant to the Reverend Herbert Wigan in Dunsden,
Oxfordshire. While performing his duties in the rural slums of Dunsden,
Owen , who was raised in relatively privileged middle-class household,
witnessed the rampant illness and poverty in the lives of the people who
lived there. According to poet and critic Cecil Day-Lewis, this experience
shook Owens faith and forced him to look outwards at the real world
(16), thus planting the seeds of intense sympathy and empathy that would
grow into the guiding principles of the war poetry that made him famous.
      In Owens preface to his posthumously published Collected Poems, his
philosophy is summed up with a haunting simplicity: This book is not about
heroes. Above all I am not concerned with Poetry. My subject is War, and
the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity (Owen 31). Owens pity reaches
from the abyssal horror of the front lines with its bullets, shells, gas,
mud, vermin, and annihilation (Dulce et Decorum Est, Exposure)to the
home front (Smile, Smile, Smile,), and to the liminal spaces of hospitals
and societal exile where survivors with broken bodies (Disabled), and
minds (Mental Cases, Conscious) live out their terrible fates. Indeed,
Owen knew these liminal spaces well, as much of his poetic development
occurred within the confines of Craiglockhart War Hospital from June to
October 1917  while he recovered from a concussion and shell-shock or
neurasthenia, now recognized as post-traumatic stress disorder. Under the
guidance of his friend, artistic mentor, and fellow Uranian (or
homosexual) Siegfried Sassoon, and his physician, Dr. Arthur Brock (1879-
1947), Owen translated his nightmares into such works as Dulce et Decorum
Est and Strange Meeting, which are two of his most powerful and enduring
poems.
      Owen was notoriously excluded from The Oxford Book of Modern Verse
(1936), an anthology edited by William Butler Yeats, another of the
twentieth-centurys preeminent poets. Das argues that this exclusion was
Yeatss deliberate act of retaliation on the [nineteen] thirties poets who
ignored him and instead drew on the works of Owen for their inspiration
(432). Despite this setback, Owens reputation has increased; his works are
widely considered to be some of the finest poetry on war ever written in
the English language. Who can say what heights Owen could have reached had
his life not been cut short in battle? He was killed in action at the
Sambre Canal in France on November 4, 1918.
