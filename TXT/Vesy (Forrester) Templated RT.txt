Vesy

The Scales, ВЕСЫ

A Russian monthly journal devoted to criticism, literature and art, appearing from January 1904 to December 1909. Vesy was a leading organ of Russian Symbolism, a crucial place for Symbolists and others to publish poetry, polemical essays, and criticism, along with reports on art and culture in Europe. Funded by Sergei A. Polyakov, Vesy was guided by editor and Symbolist poet Valery Briusov. The journal published work by Balmont, Bely, Blok, Briusov, Zinaida Gippius, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Merezhkovsky, Rozanov, Sologub, and Voloshin, plus lesser-known Symbolists and younger poets, with criticism by Gippius (as Anton Krainy), Mikhail Kuzmin, and others. The journal was richly illustrated, favoring classical and decadent themes in the World of Art style. Open to multiple aesthetic, philosophical and religious positions, Vesy appealed to cultured and cosmopolitan readers while striving to shape the social opinions of its audience.

Vesy covered the middle years of Russian Modernism, picking up traits from earlier literary journals and shaping expectations for successors such as Apollon. The standard translation, The Scales, neglects the title’s alternative meaning, ‘Libra’. Like the publishing house Skorpion (Scorpio/The Scorpion), which issued Vesy, the name reflects the Silver Age fascination with astrology and other esoteric systems.
