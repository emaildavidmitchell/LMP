Japanese Secession (1020/1000)


In 1920, a group of Japanese architects that had been  progressively  taking
interest in ART NOUVEAU or 'Jugenstil', created  a  society  that  shared  a
common approach concerning the  future  of  architecture  in  Japan.  Taking
inspiration in the Austro-Hungarian  version  of  Jugenstil  (known  as  the
VIENNA  SECESSION)  they   decided   on   the   name   Bunriha   (literally,
Secessionist Group), becoming  known  as  Japanese  Secession.  They  were
trying to secede from certain practices in the architectural  profession  at
the time, which made them feel  obligated  to  use  exclusively  traditional
styles and manipulate ornament superficially. Furthermore, like the  Austro-
Hungarian Secession (18971939), Japan was also  trying  to  come  to  terms
with the issue of identity. Bunrihas  foundation  proclaimed  a  manifesto,
claiming that architecture should not be exclusively about  engineering  but
also  was  a  form  of  artistic   expression.   The   Secession   respected
architectures functionalism but defended a broader interpretation  of  what
that could mean, ie. not disregarding aesthetics.

Japanese Secession was started by a group of  architects  who  had  recently
completed their studies  at  Tokyo  Imperial  University:  HORIGUCHI  Sutemi
(18951984) and YAMADA  Mamoru  (18941966),  ISHIMOTO  Kikuji  (18941963),
MAYUMI Takizawa (18961983), KEIICHI Morita (1895-1983),  and  SHIGERU  Yada
(1896-1958)  later on joined by  YAMAGUCHI  Bunzo  (19001978)  and  KURATA
Chikatada  (18951966).  Officially  presented  as  Bunriha   Kenchiku   kai
(Bunriha Architectural Society),  the  formation  of  the  group  marks  the
beginning of the modern movement in Japan.

Up until the 1850s, Japanese architecture, regarded  each  new  style  as  a
minor variation of an older form, never existing a complete rejection of  an
existing style: old and new co-existed  harmoniously.   After  centuries  of
isolation,  Japan  started  promoting  contact  with  other   countries   in
18531854, and that shook Japans sense of  identity.  While  some  welcomed
it, others criticized or feared it.  During the 1860s and  1870s,  in  order
to prove its administrative efficiency,  and  demonstrating  they  were  not
backwards,  the  Japanese  Government  commissioned  a  number  of   foreign
architects to  plan  public  buildings,  schools  and  factories,  welcoming
architects to exercise the prevailing styles of their own  countries.  Also,
an English architect,  Josiah  Conder  (18521920),  was  invited  to  start
lecturing at the Faculty of Architecture of Tokyo  Technical  University  in
1877,  training  many  Japanese  in  European  style  architecture  bringing
significant changes to the way architecture was conceived.  Conder  replaced
wood for brick and later on came up with  a  system  that  proved  effective
against earthquakes, using steel frame construction or composite  brick  and
steel frame structures. In the mid-1890s, Rikichi SANO developed the use  of
reinforced  concrete,  which  became  an  essential  feature   in   Japanese
architecture for many years to come. By 1889 Japan had transitioned  from  a
feudal system to a constitutional monarchy.

Conders approach led to the prevalence of  an  eclectic  style  where  some
buildings were either fully Western or  Eastern  looking.  Against  Conders
school/ legacy, the Secession, stood for  creation,  instead  of  imitation.
FRANK LLOYD WRIGHTs (18671959) Tokyo Imperial Hotel (1923) (img.1)  was  a
strong example of how  West  and  East  could  be  successfully  harmonized,
proving to be a key reference.  Many celebrated  Western  influence,  others
strongly opposed; some defended a synthesis  between  Western  and  Japanese
architecture, others aimed at a preservation of what they considered  to  be
national heritage  with its prevailing use of wood.  Struggling to find  an
identity, and trying to come  to  terms  with  its  newfound  openness,  the
period between 1889 and 1912, known as the Meiji period,  was  characterized
by a general strong nationalist appeal. By the 1920s, Japan  was  political
and economically stronger and the national spirit was not so pressing  and
movements like the  Secession  played  an  important  role  in  Japans  new
identity.

Japanese Secession defended the ability  of  the  artist  being  allowed  to
express his own freedom, regardless of directly celebrating the nation,  the
East or West. Before, the nation had strived for an  identity,  and  in  the
1920s, architects fought for  the  right  to  express  their  own  identity.
Between 1920 and 1928, the Secession,  promoted  exhibitions  of  plans  and
models that envisioned how the country could look like (img.2). A series  of
buildings actually took form, all in the Tokyo  area:  HIROGUCHIs  Memorial
Tower at the Peace Exhibition (1922)  modeled  on  JOSEPH  MARIA  OLBRICHs
Wedding Tower in Darmstadt of 19071908. (img.3) YAMADAs Central  Telegraph
Office (1926), reminiscent of French Gothic (img.4),  and  ISHIMOTOs  Asahi
Newspaper Building (1927) (img.5).  Not  only  Jungenstil  but  also  German
Expressionism proved to be a big influence  allowing  Secessionists  greater
freedom  to  develop  their  structural  ideas  and  detail  design   though
frequently Japanese traditional architecture features  were  also  included.

Around this time, another movement was inaugurated in 1925: the Japan avant-
garde.  The  one  was  highly  receptive  to   international   architectural
movements  and  willing  to  directly  embody  and  communicate  with  other
movements like the BAUHAUS, DE STIJL and  Esprit  Nouveau.  Furthermore,  by
that time, several Japanese architects had  been  in  Europe,  working,  for
example, with LE CORBUSIER. Modernism,  joined  architecture  and  urbanism,
and social housing was of  particular  interest  to  Japanese  architects  
which some faced as a key instrument to promote social change. This  reveled
itself useful due to the 1923 Great Kant earthquake and several wars  which
seemed to force Japan to constantly rebuilt and reinvent itself.

The new Japan avant-garde movement was joined by  members  of  the  Japanese
Secession, HORIGUCHI and YAMADA, and it could  be  said  that  it  was  this
movement that continued the Secession principles. It  stood  for  individual
freedom in the arts, including  architecture,  and  defended  the  right  to
artistic expression, independent of any social constrictions or any kind  of
agenda ran by the government or any kind of organization   and  perhaps  in
that sense it can be said that a  correspondence  exists  between  Secession
and what the West classifies as Modernism.
