GUMILEV, Nikolai (, ) (1886-1921)


Russian writer known for his poetry, translations, and literary criticism.
He is also remembered as the founder of the Acmeist movement, which
included such outstanding poets as Anna AKHMATOVA (his wife) and Osip
MANDELSTAM. He was born near St. Petersburg and lived there for most of his
life, but he also travelled extensively, most famously to Africa. Gumilev
distinguished himself as one of the few writers of his generation to serve
in World War One. After the war, he returned to Russia, but did not embrace
the new Soviet government. In 1921 he was arrested and executed for alleged
participation in a Tsarist conspiracy.

Nikolai Stepanovich Gumilev was born on 15 April  1889  (3  April  1889  Old
Style) to a military family in the town of Kronstadt  near  St.  Petersburg.
There Gumilev  attended  a  high  school  directed  by  the  poet  Innokenty
Annensky and met his future wife and  fellow-Acmeist  Anna  Akhmatova  (born
Gorenko). He began writing poetry at age  twelve  and  published  his  first
poem at age sixteen. In his early  years,  Gumilev  was  influenced  by  the
SYMBOLIST movement. He became acquainted with the poet Valery BRIUSOV  after
the latter published a negative review of his  first  book  of  poems,  Put'
konkvistadorov (The Path of the Conquistadors) (1905).  Gumilev  appreciated
the older writer's criticism and began to consider  him  his  mentor.  After
spending two years studying at the Sorbonne in Paris and  traveling  as  far
as Egypt, Gumilev returned to St. Petersburg in 1908.
       During  the  period  between  1908   and   1910,   Gumilev   actively
participated in St. Petersburg literary life. He  befriended  the  Symbolist
poet Vyacheslav IVANOV, one of Briusov's rivals.  He  also  became  involved
with  the  literary  journal  Apollon  (Apollo),  where  he   published   an
influential review column, Letters on Russian Poetry.   In  1909  he  took
another trip to Africa, this time  visiting  Ethiopia  (then  Abyssinia),  a
country that would become personally  significant  to  him  because  of  the
personal and cultural  connections  he  made  there.  In  1910,  he  married
Akhmatova, and soon afterwards embarked alone  on  another,  longer  African
journey.
In 1911, Gumilev and Ivanov had a serious literary  quarrel.  As  a  result,
Gumilev and another of Ivanov's former students, Sergei  Gorodetsky,  formed
an anti-Symbolist movement called ACMEISM. The  other  official  members  of
this group were Osip Mandelstam,  Anna  Akhmatova,  Mikhail  Zenkevich,  and
Vladimir Narbut. These poets  were  stylistically  diverse,  but  united  in
their opposition to Symbolism's mystical  worldview.  They  were  affiliated
with a larger  group  called  the  Poets'  Guild.  Gumilev's  first  Acmeist
collection, Chuzhoe nebo (The Alien Sky), came out in 1912.
      In the same year Gumilev and Akhmatova  had  a  son,  Lev,  who  would
become   a   famous   and   controversial   historian,    ethnologist    and
anthropologist.  The  couple   became   estranged   soon   afterwards.   St.
Petersburg's Ethnographic  Museum  sponsored  Gumilevs  fourth  journey  to
Africa in 1913. After returning,  he  published  a  range  of  new  literary
works, including several plays. In 1916 Gumilev enlisted in World  War  One,
where he  won  two  medals  for  bravery.  The  same  year  he  published  a
collection of war poetry, Kolchan (The Quiver). After travelling in  England
and France, he returned to Soviet Russia, remarried, and began working as  a
translator and teacher of poetry. He also continued writing his own  poetry,
publishing his finest collections Koster (The Bonfire) in 1918 and  Ognennyi
stolp (The Pillar of Fire) in 1921. In this mature period, Gumilev's  poetic
work was notable for its unique combination of realism  and  myth,  as  well
its distinctively modern verse techniques, such as the  tonic  or  accentual
dolnik meter.
Although he willingly returned  to  Russia  after  the  Revolution,  Gumilev
openly opposed the Bolshevik regime. In  1920  he  became  involved  in  the
Taganstev  group  of  conspirators.  The  extent  of  his  participation  is
unknown, but in 1921 he was arrested for conspiring to restore the Tsar  and
executed. Gumilev is considered to be one of the first literary  victims  of
the Red Terror.
