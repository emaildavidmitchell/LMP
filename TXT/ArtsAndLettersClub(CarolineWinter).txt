The Arts and Letters Club

The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto

The Arts and Letters Club is a Canadian private club for artists and their patrons. For more than a century, the Club has played an important role in Canadian culture, providing a meeting space for and fostering a community of visual and literary artists, actors, musicians, designers, and architects. It is housed at St. George’s Hall in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, a building of National Historic Significance.



The Arts and Letters Club was founded in 1908 by Augustus Bridle, an arts journalist, to promote the arts in Canada. The Club is best known for its connection with the Group of Seven. The original Group of Seven, established in 1920, included Frank Johnston, Lawren Harris, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, Frederic Varley, Franklin Carmichael, and A. Y. Jackson. Members to join after the Group’s founding included Edwin Holgate, A. J. Casson, and LeMoine FitzGerald. The Group of Seven is known for their paintings of the Canadian landscape. These artists met frequently at the Club to socialize and share ideas.

The Arts and Letters Club was founded in 1908 by Augustus Bridle, an arts journalist, to promote the arts in Canada. The Club is best known for its connection with the Group of Seven. The original Group of Seven, established in 1920, included Frank Johnston, Lawren Harris, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, Frederic Varley, Franklin Carmichael, and A. Y. Jackson. Members to join after the Group’s founding included Edwin Holgate, A. J. Casson, and LeMoine FitzGerald. The Group of Seven is known for their paintings of the Canadian landscape. These artists met frequently at the Club to socialize and share ideas. 



The Arts and Letters Club is closely associated with St. George’s Hall, which was built in 1891. The Club leased the building for its headquarters in 1920 and purchased it in 1986. One of the building’s main features is The Great Hall, a dining room and bar decorated with banners depicting the Club’s earliest members, drawn by J. E. H. MacDonald.  It also features a smaller dining room and a studio, where the Club’s visual artists hold painting sessions. The building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2007. 



The club has about 600 members and continues to offer social events such as lunches and dinners, as well as exhibitions and performances. Traditions include an annual Boar’s Head procession and Spring Revue. It has published two anthologies of writing called The Longship Review and maintains archives of the Club’s activities.
