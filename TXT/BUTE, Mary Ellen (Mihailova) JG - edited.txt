Bute, Mary Ellen (21 November, 1906 17 October, 1983)

One of the first female experimental animators in America, Mary Ellen Bute
was born in Houston, Texas in 1906. She studied painting at the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and lighting and set design at the Yale
School of Drama. Her interest in lighting proved crucial to her filmmaking:
together with her husband and cinematographer Ted Nemeth (1911  1986), she
explored the possibilities of visual expression of sound by controlling a
source of light to produce images in rhythm.

In the 1930s, she worked with Joseph Schillinger (1895  1943), a music
theorist who used mathematical formulae to compose music. Their
collaboration inspired visual music shorts synchronizing classical music
with abstract shapes produced through light play and mixed media. Notable
examples include Rhythm in Light (1934), Parabola (1937), and Polka Graph
(1947).

In the 1950s, Bute made two shorts using a modified oscilloscope: Abstronic
(1954) and Mood Contrasts (1956). The director manipulated and animated the
abstract patterns generated by the oscilloscope in response to music and
edited them with the corresponding tunes, inviting the viewer to see
sound.

In 1956, Bute ventured into live-action filmmaking, producing the short The
Boy Who Saw Through. Over the span of three years (1965-7), she completed
her only feature film, Passages from Finnegans Wake, becoming the first
filmmaker to adapt James Joyce for the silver screen.
