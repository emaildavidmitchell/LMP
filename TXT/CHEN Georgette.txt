CHEN Li Ying Georgette (1906-1993)
Georgette Chen was a Chinese migr artist who settled in Singapore in 1953
and taught at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) until 1981. Described
as the most influential pioneer female artist in Singapore, Chen brought
modernist ideas to the nascent Malayan art world and was instrumental in
fostering modernism in local art practice. Her oil paintings, which
remained her strongest and most proficient medium, were initially
influenced by the Realist and Barbizon Schools and later by French Post-
Impressionism and especially Fauvism in her approach toward colour. Her
mastery of modernism culminated in a synthesis of Western and Eastern
philosophies, which was best represented by her portraits, tropical still
lives and plein air paintings of everyday scenes in the Malayan landscape 
all of which conveyed a distinct local flavour. Chen was known as the first
generation of Nanyang artists, most of who were affiliated to NAFA as
teachers, and who were responsible for bringing to Malaya a sophistication
and cosmopolitanism that was deemed missing in the local art scene.

She said that once the REM sources permissions for this image from the
National Art Gallery of Singapore they will provide a high res image.  If
there is a problem with this, she offered to seek the permissions and
obtain the image sooner.  Please let me know what is better for the REM in
this case.

Chen was already an accomplished artist when she arrived in Malaya. Her
works were exhibited in numerous prestigious group exhibitions in Paris, at
Salon des Tuileries and Salon des Independents, and collected by Musee du
Jeu de Paume. Born in China in 1906* to an affluent family with worldwide
businesses and extensive political connections, Chen received private art
training from age fourteen and was educated in several cosmopolitan
centres: Shanghai, Paris (Academie Colarossi and Academie Biloul), and New
York (Art Students League). Her art career was further supported by her
husband, Chen Youren, the first foreign minister of the Republic of China.
He was a favourite subject of her portraits until his death at the end of
World War Two.
Chens second marriage to Ho Yung Chi was an unhappy one. They settled
briefly in Penang where she taught at Han Chiang School for two years
before relocating to Singapore, shortly after her separation from Ho. She
accepted Lim Hak Tais invitation to teach at NAFA, a charming art school
that reminded her of Parisan studios. Chens commitment to the Academy was
instrumental to realizing the institutions goals; through her connections
with Chapelain-Midy, her students studied at Ecole Nationale Superieure des
Beaux Arts. Chen is the only female artist honoured with two retrospective
shows in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in 1985 and 1986 respectively. She was
formally recognized as a Pioneer Artist in 1982. At 86, Chen died in March
1993 after a long series of illnesses which kept her bed-ridden for the
last eleven years of her life.
* Chens birthplace and date remain ambiguous. Though Chen herself said she
was born in Paris in 1907, her marriage certificate stated her birthplace
to be Zhejiang Province, China in 1906.
