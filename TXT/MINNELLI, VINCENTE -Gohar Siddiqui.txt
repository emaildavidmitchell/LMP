VINCENTE MINNELLI (b. 28 February, 1903, Chicago, Illinois, USA; d. 25 July 1986, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA) 



Vincente Minnelli’s past career as a designer of display windows in a Chicago department store, stage settings designer for Radio City Music Hall, and Designer-director of Broadway shows contributed to his career as a director of MGM films. In particular, his spectacular artistic vision, use of color, and camera work is put to expressionist use in the lavish MGM musicals produced by the famous Arthur Freed unit. He directed award-winning musicals like An American in Paris (1951), The Band Wagon (1953), and Gigi (1958). 



Minnelli’s films are heavily influenced by art nouveau, the early modernism of the impressionists, and surrealists. The long dream ballet in An American in Paris is comprised of sequences which include paintings that come to life. These paintings invoke various artists like Toulouse-Lautrec, Dufy, Van Gogh, and Rousseau. Similarly, “The Girl Hunt” ballet in The Band Wagon self-reflexively calls attention to the film as entertainment and forces a consideration of high versus low art. Minnelli’s excessive bricolage and stylization, however, pushed the boundaries of his aesthetics and “infuse[d] in his films a camp sensibility” that raises the modernist question about distinguishing mass culture and commercialism from art and authenticity (James Naremore 13). 



He married Judy Garland while Meet Me in St Louis (1944) was under production and the two had a daughter, Liza Minnelli, the successful contemporary American actress.
