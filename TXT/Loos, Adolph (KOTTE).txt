Loos, Adolf (1870-1933)
Born in Brno, Moravia, Austria-Hungary, now Czech Republic, Adolf Loos was
a critic, architect and designer famous for his vehement rejection of
ornament. Educated in Dresden, Germany, he lived in the United States from
1893 to 1896 and developed a lifelong admiration for the American way of
life. In 1896, he moved to Vienna, where he practiced for the longest
period of his life. Loos main contribution to modernism was, however, in
the realm of theory and writing. In a 1908 essay entitled Ornament and
Crime he claimed that the evolution of culture is synonymous with the
removal of ornament from objects of daily use (Loos 167)
Although his functional, rectilinear boxes such as Steiner House (1910)
were met with little enthusiasm at the time, Looss buildings appear to
anticipate the International Style of the 1920s as well as Le Corbusiers
(1887-1965) architectural purism. The stark exteriors of Looss work
contrast with their sumptuous interiors, clad in rich woods or marble.
Looss Raumplan or spatial development conceived of rooms as a progression
of interlocking spaces differing in room height. Loos acted as chief
architect of Viennas Housing Department from 1922 to 1924. He then moved
to Paris, where he built a house for the Dada writer Tristan Tzara (1896-
1963) in 1926-27 before returning to Vienna in 1927. A friend of the critic
and journalist Karl Kraus (1874-1936) and philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein
(1889-1951), Loos supported Expressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka (1886-
1980) and composer Arnold Schnberg (1874-1951).
