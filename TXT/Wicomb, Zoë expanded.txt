Wicomb, Zo (1948)

Novelist, short story writer, and essayist Zoe Wicomb was born in
Namaqualand, South Africa. Much of her fiction and criticism deals with the
construction of racial identity in South Africa; under the Apartheid
system, Wicomb and her family were considered coloured, the label applied
to, among others, persons of mixed racial background. Her first collection
of linked short stories, You Cant Get Lost in Cape Town (1987), follows a
young mixed-race woman as she leaves Namaqualand for an education in Cape
Town and abroad, developing a political and writerly identity in response
to the pressures of Apartheids racialized political climate. The novel
Davids Story (2000) moves to the reconstruction era, interweaving the 1991
memoirs of David Dirkse, a fictional member of the armed wing of the
African National Congress, with an account of the cross-country treks of
the Griqua people under the leadership of Andrew Le Fleur in the nineteenth
century. Playing in the Light (2006) examines the legacy of Apartheid
hierarchies, as a white South African discovers in the late 1990s that
her parents had been categorized as coloured under the regime. The One
that Got Away (2008) is a series of stories set in Glasgow and South Africa
and linked by a group of often tangentially related characters.

Although her fiction draws on elements of her own life, Wicomb thwarts easy
parallels by emphasizing the literary artifice involved in all writing. In
You Cant Get Lost in Cape Town, for instance, protagonist and narrator
Frieda Shenton initially indicates that her mother died young, an assertion
contradicted by the later reappearance of her mother, who criticizes
Friedas fictional reworkings of the familys past. With its emphasis on
autobiography as an act of selective narration, Davids Story similarly
undermines the reliability of storytelling of all kinds. These acts of
fictive self-narration mirror processes of national and racial construction
Wicomb identifies in both Apartheid and post-Apartheid South Africa.
