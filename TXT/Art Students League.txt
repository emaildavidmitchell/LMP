Art Students League of New York				



The Art Students League (ASL) is a Manhattan art school, founded in 1875, “by artists and for artists.” ASL was founded when the National Academy of Design (NAD) announced that it would temporarily suspend its studio classes. Using this opportunity to break out of the orbit of the conservative academy, a group of ASL students, with the help of former NAD instructor Lemuel Wilmarth (who became the school’s first instructor and president), announced the founding of a new school. ASL’s primary mission is to promote and enable the creative objectives of the artists in attendance; as such the format of the schools is an atelier system, a collection of semi-autonomous studios the focus of which is determined by a professional artist who runs the studio and instruction. Many of America’s best-known modern artists from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries had a role to play in the League. They include Romare Bearden, George Bellows, Thomas Hart Benton, William Merritt Chase, Thomas Eakins, Helen Frankenthaler, Hans Hofmann, Donald Judd, Lee Krasner, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg and Mark Rothko. The ASL continues to rank among the best art schools in the U.S. and to promote openness in terms of student admissions and artistic experimentation.
