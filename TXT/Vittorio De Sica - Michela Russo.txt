Vittorio De Sica

Michela Russo

Vittorio De Sica (Vittorio Domenico Stanislao Gaetano Sorano De Sica.  Sora,
July 7, 1901  Neuilly-sur-Seine, November 13, 1974) was an Italian  theater
and film actor, director and screenwriter.  He  is  considered  one  of  the
fathers of Italian Neorealism and of the  Commedia  all'italiana  (Italian-
style comedy), an Italian film genre in vogue between  the  1950s  and  the
1970s that, taking the Neorealist lesson as its starting point,  ironically,
and sometimes bitterly,  reflects  the  evolution  of  Italian  society.  De
Sicas career begins as an actor in theaters in the 1920s,  and  almost  ten
years later on the big screen.

De Sica starts off as a film director in the 1940s with Maddalena  zero  in
condotta (1940), which  recalls  the  cinema  of  telefoni  bianchi  (white
telephones, taking the name from the Art Deco sets style), made  in  Italy
during the 1930s in imitation of  contemporary  American  comedies.  In  the
same year he makes, with Giuseppe Amato, Rose scarlatte  (1940),  the  story
of a woman being courted  by  a  mysterious  admirer  who  is  actually  her
husband. In the following years he  directs  Teresa  venerd  (1941),  on  a
foundling girl that falls in love with the director of  the  orphanage,  and
Un garibaldino al convento  (1942),  a  hilarious  historical  story  taking
place during  Garibaldis  epoch.  In  1943  with  I  bambini  ci  guardano,
considered a film precursor of neorealism as well as the 1945 La  porta  del
cielo,  De  Sica  officially  collaborates  with  the  screenwriter   Cesare
Zavattini. This  experience  gives  birth  to  that  extraordinary  creative
partnership that will lead to  the  famous  neorealist  tetralogy:  Sciusci
(1946), Ladri di biciclette (1948), Miracolo a Milano  (1951),  and  Umberto
D. (1952). Sciusci,  considered  the  third  neorealist  masterpiece  after
Rossellinis Rome Open City (1945)  and  Paisan  (1946),  tells  the  tragic
story of two shoeshine boys  who,  in  order  to  buy  a  white  horse,  get
involved in a robbery and end up in a reformatory. In Italy the  film  is  a
commercial failure, but in 1948 it receives the Oscar for the  Best  Foreign
Film.  Ladri  di  Bicliclette,  drawn  on  the  homonymous  novel  by  Luigi
Bartolini (1946), is the story of Antonio Ricci  (Lamberto  Maggiorani),  an
unemployed family man who finds a job as a  municipal  bill  sticker,  whose
bicycle, indispensable for the job, is stolen. For this movie, De Sica  wins
the second Oscar to Best Foreign Film. However, with Miracolo  a  Milano,  a
story of an orphan boy that dreams an imaginary world, winner of the  Cannes
Palm DOr, De Sica moves slightly away  from  the  neorealist  path,  mixing
fable and realistic elements. Umberto D., a masterpiece  on  the  themes  of
old age and loneliness, dedicated to De Sicas father, is considered  to  be
the last De Sica neorealist film. After Umberto  D.,  the  couple  De  Sica-
Zavattini undergoes an involution, De Sica shoots  Stazione  Termini  (1953)
and the episodic film LOro  di  Napoli,  but  later  they  return  to  work
together with two realist pieces: Il tetto (1956),  the  story  of  a  young
married couple unable to find a house who decide to build one in one  night,
and La ciociara (1960), an adaptation of  Alberto  Moravias  novel  of  the
same title with Sofia Loren who wins the Oscar for the  Best  Actress.  They
also work together in Il giudizio universale (1961), which has a  surrealist
flavor, and I Sequestrati di Altona (1962), from a Sartres' drama,  starring
Sofia Loren. Sofia Loren will also act in the  episode  "La  riffa"  in  the
collective film Boccaccio '70 (1962), in Ieri, oggi, domani (1963),  teaming
up with Marcello  Mastroianni,  in  Matrimonio  all'italiana  (1964),  third
Oscar for De Sica, and I Girasoli  (1970).  In  1970  De  Sica  obtains  his
fourth Oscar with the film transposition of the novel by  Giorgio  Bassani's
Il Giardino dei Finzi-Contini, a drama about the  persecution  of  a  Jewish
family in Ferrara during the fascist period. The last film De  Sica  directs
is an adaptation of Luigi Pirandello, Il viaggio (1974), again  with  Sophia
Loren. De Sica dies in Neuilly (France) on 13 November 1974  following  lung
surgery.
