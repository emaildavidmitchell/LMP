Albers is particularly known for his series of paintings several hundred paintings 

Homage to the Square, which he began in 1950. In this series, three or four painted squares of differing hue, colour value, and saturation are nested within one another, creating various optical effects as one square appears to float above another, or as colour differentiation is neutralized. The concept that the chromic context in which any one colour is situated contributes to its relative appearance stems from Albers’ teaching of the topic and his important publication Interaction of Color (1963). Albers also designed furnishings, worked in stained and etched glass, and made prints. He taught at Black Mountain College near Asheville, North Carolina, between 1933 and 1949, and at Yale University from 1950 until 1958.
