ODOEVTSEVA, Irina Vladimirovna (ОДОЕВЦЕВА, ИРИНА ВЛАДИМИРОВНА) (real name Гейнике, Ираида Густавовна  (Heinike, Iraida Gustavovna))  (1895-1990)

Poet, memoirist and novelist with roots in the Acmeist literary movement, Odoevtseva is best known for her two volumes of memoirs, which portray many of the leading figures of the Russian Silver Age. Born in Riga, she died in Leningrad.  She moved to Petrograd in 1918, where she studied poetry under Nikolai GUMILEV, joined the second Guild of Poets, and published one book of verse.  In 1922 she emigrated to France with her husband, poet Georgy IVANOV (1894-1958), spending most of her life in Paris at the center of Russian émigré literary society, and visiting the U.S. once. In emigration, Odoevtseva initially turned to writing prose, with female protagonists as the focus of her interwar novels.  In the post-WWII period, she published several volumes of poetry, continued to place her work in various literary journals, and worked on the staff of Russkaia mysl’ (Russian Thought).  Georgii Ivanov died in 1958, and in 1978 she married writer Iakov Nikolaevich Gorbov (1896-1982).  In 1987 Odoevtseva returned permanently to Leningrad at the invitation of the Writers’ Union.  She was warmly welcomed, and attained her lifelong dream of reconnecting with Russian audiences through public appearances and the publication of some of her works.
