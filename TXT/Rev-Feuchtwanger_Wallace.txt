Feuchtwanger, Lion (1884-1958)
Born into a Jewish family in Munich, Lion Feuchtwanger lived in Berlin from
1925 until 1933 when Hitlers accession to power forced him into exile,
first in France and then, following the fall of France in 1940, in
California where he died in 1958. He achieved international fame with a
series of sixteen best-selling, widely translated novels published between
1923 and 1957. He was widely criticised for his positive account in Moskau
1937 (Moscow 1937) of his visit to Stalins USSR. Unholdes Frankreich (The
Devil in France) describes his internment in France as an enemy alien prior
to his flight to the USA.

Erfolg (Success) represents a cutting critique of the culture of
Feuchtwangers native Bavaria. It is formally his most experimental novel,
combining striking filmic qualities (such as rapid changes of scene and
perspective, or a focus on parallel events) with the use of documentary
montage and the punctuation of the narrative with essayistic commentaries.
These features, like the use of a narrator who sees events from the
perspective of the twenty-first century, are exploited for ironic effect.
Feuchtwangers historical novels, he believed, compel the reader to see
the present more clearly by distancing himself. Waffen fr Amerika (Proud
Destiny) suggests a parallel between the anti-British alliance of France
and America in the eighteenth century and that of the USA and USSR against
Nazi Germany. Based on the story of a prominent Jewish financier in
eighteenth-century Wrttemberg who was executed in an antisemitic backlash,
Jud Sss inspired numerous film, theatre and radio adaptations, including
its misuse by the Nazis in the antisemitic propaganda film of the same name
directed by Veit Harlan.

Feuchtwanger collaborated with Bertolt Brecht on three plays, including Die
Gesichte der Simone Machard (The Visions of Simone Machard), the story of a
French girls resistance to the Nazis which Feuchtwanger also turned into a
novel, but he remained sceptical about Brechts theory of epic theatre.
