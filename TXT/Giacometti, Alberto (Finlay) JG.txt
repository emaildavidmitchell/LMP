Giacometti, Giovanni Alberto (19011966)

Alberto Giacometti was a titan of twentieth-century art. His rich oeuvre of
sculpture, painting and drawing ranks alongside pioneering artists such as
Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Constantin Brncui.

Giacometti arrived in Paris in 1922 to study at the Acadmie de la Grande
Chaumire in Montparnasse with Frances then-leading sculptor, Emile-
Antoine Bourdelle. Giacometti attended periodically until 1927, principally
creating drawings in a Cubist manner. By the mid-to-late 1920s,
Giacomettis sculpture was intimately associated with Surrealism. His
exhibition at the Gallery Pierre in particular attracted the attention of
Surrealist leader Andr Breton, who would later acquire Giacomettis
Suspended Ball (1930). The same exhibition also drew the admiration and
support of fellow artists and future friends Andr Masson, Hans Arp, Man
Ray, Salvador Dal, and Pablo Picasso. During 1929-30, Giacometti not only
became close friends with art theorists like Georges Bataille, Michel
Leiris, and others surrounding the dissident periodical Documents, but also
important writers and intellectuals such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Samuel
Beckett and Simone de Beauvoir. By 1934, Giacometti departed the Surrealist
milieu. The rupture coincided with his return to the use of life models and
brought about a new philosophical awareness in his sculpture. Existential
theories relating to isolation, helplessness and disquiet drawn  from the
writings of Jean-Paul Sartre, including Nausea (1938) and Being and
Nothingness (1943) correspond to Giacomettis tall standing figures of the
late 1940s and early 1950s.

Giacometti was born on October 10, 1901 in the village of Borgonovo in the
Bregaglia valley, in Italian-speaking Switzerland. His father, Giovanni,
was a post-impressionist painter who had studied in Paris. His mother,
Annette, came from a wealthy family in the locality of Stampa. Giacometti
had three siblings: brothers Bruno and Diego and sister Ottilia. Bruno was
also an artist-craftsman who would inhabit Albertos life and work,
consistently posing for him Brunos death in 1961.

Influenced by modernist movements in Paris and inspired by tribal art,
including ancient Egyptian, Cycladic, Sumerian, African, Oceanic and
Mesoamerican forms, Giacometti synthesized these primitive sources with
the Cubist idiom to develop, in 1926-27, a series of highly compact,
totemic works that strongly recall the sculptures of Brncui, Henri
Laurens and Jacques Lipchitz. Giacomettis interest in the Cubist
vocabulary is evidenced by figurative compositions that include Torso (1925-
26, Alberto Giacometti Foundation, Kunsthaus, Zurich) and Man [Cubist
Composition] (c. 1926-27, plaster version, Ohara Museum, Kurashiki, Japan).
The latter simultaneously demonstrates the sculptors working knowledge of
Cubism as well as his gradual move towards a surrealist visualisation of
the figure, where the form is merged with, or menaced by, eerie claw- or
pitchfork-like elements. Giacometti soon acquired a reputation as one of
the most original sculptors working in Paris. By 1929-30, his work began to
gather critical momentum, featuring in important exhibitions of
contemporary sculpture including the Galerie Georges Bernheim and the
Galerie Pierre [Loeb] in Paris. Here sculptures such as Three Figures
Outdoors (1929) and the famous Suspended Ball (1930, Private collection,
Paris) were exhibited in the company of illustrious sculptors including
Aristide Maillol, Brncui, Lipchitz, Joan Mir and Alexander Calder.
Giacomettis works of the late 1920s and early 1930s combine an exploration
of forms with intimations of physical violence, onanistic sex and pain, and
are an obvious reassessment of Surrealist themes. In works such as Head on
a Rod (1947, Collection M. and Mme Maeght, Paris), The Hand (1947, Alberto
Giacometti Foundation, Kunstmuseum, Winterthur), and Three Men Walking
(1948, Foundation Marguerite et Aim Maeght, St Paul) there is a
preoccupation with the tragedy of the human condition and seemingly
anguished figures: figures placed in bleak isolation and wasted away by the
surrounding space.
