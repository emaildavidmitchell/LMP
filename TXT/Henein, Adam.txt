Henein, Adam (b. 1929)

Born in Cairo, Egypt, Adam Henein is one of the leading contemporary
sculptors of the Arab World. Throughout his career, he produced large and
small-scale pieces using materials, such as granite, bronze, plaster,
limestone and terracotta. His work is inspired by the graceful solidity of
ancient Egyptian statuary and expresses a sense of simplicity in the
treatment of mass and volumes. Henein is also a talented painter and he
renewed ancient techniques, such as natural pigments on papyrus sheets.
Graduating from the School of Fine Arts in Cairo in 1953, he received a
scholarship in 1957 to pursue his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in
Munich. In 1971, he moved to Paris, where he stayed for twenty-five years.
By the time he returned to Egypt in 1996, he enjoyed an international
recognition. From 1989 to 1998, he was appointed by the Ministry of Culture
to participate in the restoration of the Sphinx in Giza. In 1996, he
founded the Aswan International Sculpture Symposium.
