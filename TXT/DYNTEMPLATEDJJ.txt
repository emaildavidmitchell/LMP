|In Mexico City, at the height of World War II, the Viennese          |
|expatriate artist Wolfgang Paalen founded and edited DYN, an         |
|international art journal that distinguished him as a theorist and   |
|scholar of modern and ethnographic art. The journal was instrumental |
|in the development of the avant-garde art in Mexico and New York,    |
|particularly Abstract Expressionism. In DYN, Paalen published his own|
|essays, criticism, poetry, and collections of Native American Art.   |
|The journal also featured a host of contributors, including Latin    |
|American artists such as Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Miguel Covarrubias,   |
|Csar Moro, Carlos Mrida, Martin Chambi, and Roberto Matta; European|
|artists including Henry Moore, Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Gordon|
|Onslow Ford, and Alice Rahon; New York artists Robert Motherwell,    |
|Jackson Pollock, David Smith, and William Baziotes; Mexican          |
|anthropologists and ethnologists Alfonso Caso, Miguel Angel          |
|Fernandez, and Carlos Margain Araujo; and writers Valentine Penrose, |
|Henry Miller, and Anas Nin. The five issues of DYN published between|
|1942 and 1944 inspired artists and thinkers worldwide. In 1945,      |
|following Paalens one-man exhibitions in Mexico City and New York,  |
|Robert Motherwell edited Form and Sense, an anthology of the DYN     |
|essays.                                                              |

|                                                                     |
|DYNs title was taken from the Greek t dynaton [the possible] on    |
|which Paalen erected his own Philosophy of the Possible. The         |
|Philosophy of the Possible was a concept of potential reality that   |
|advocated a new image for art in the utopian tradition of modernism. |
|It proposed a twentieth-century antidote to the ills of Western      |
|civilization during the paradigm of contemporary new physics or      |
|quantum physics. As a former Surrealist, Paalen was critical of the  |
|limitations of nineteenth-century rationalism, calling instead for a |
|link between the rational mode of science and the emotional or       |
|intuitive mode of art. He advocated art as a cure for the sickness of|
|science, focusing on the complementary relationship between the two, |
|rather than the purely oppositional.                                 |
|                                                                     |
|DYN was widely circulated and read in Latin America, the United      |
|States, and Europe. Paalens theory, manifest in his artworks and    |
|elucidated in the essays and criticism he wrote for DYN, had three   |
|major currents: aesthetics, ethnology, and the sciences. Paalens    |
|theory drew upon his early life and training in Central Europe, where|
|the artistic, scientific, and political theories of Karl Marx,       |
|Frederick Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and Werner Heisenberg, among     |
|others, altered the course of Western civilisation. While these ideas|
|informed artistic theory and practice in the nineteenth century,     |
|Paalens synthesis differed by addressing the radical revisions to   |
|philosophy and science of the early twentieth century.               |
|                                                                     |
|Paalens collections of Native American Art were published and       |
|illustrated in the most famous issue of DYN  the Amerindian (nos. |
|45, 1943). The issue included articles and essays on current        |
|anthropology and archaeology by Paalen (Totem Art), and on new     |
|archaeological ideas and discoveries by prominent anthropologists    |
|from the National Museum of Anthropology and History (INAH) such as  |
|Alfonso Caso, Miguel Angel Fernandez, and Carlos Margain Araujo. It  |
|is considered an important contribution to contemporary Native       |
|American discourse, and is considered a catalyst in the reception of |
|Native American art and culture in the Americas and abroad.          |
|                                                                     |
|In the first issue (no. 1, 1942), Paalens Farewell to Surrealism  |
|and essay-manifesto The New Image outlined a new direction for art,|
|and rallied American artists to a new set of possibilities,        |
|encouraging them to transcend the School of Paris through            |
|experimentation and innovation. Subsequent issues included a range of|
|important essays: Art and Science (DYN 3, 1942) argued for the need|
|to bridge the two disciplines; The Dialectical Gospel revisited    |
|Marxist political philosophy; Surprise and Inspiration (DYN 3,     |
|1942) explored automatism and the unconscious; while On the Meaning |
|of Cubism Today (DYN 6, 1944) outlined the problems of space and    |
|representation in modern art.                                        |
|                                                                     |
|Through DYN, Paalen played a decisive role in the genesis of Abstract|
|Expressionism. From Motherwells Mexican Sketchbooks (1941) (produced|
|while working with Paalen in Mexico), to correspondences in the      |
|artworks and writings of Motherwell, Pollock, Mark Rothko and Barnett|
|Newman beginning in 1942, Paalens imprint is clearly visible. In the|
|last issue of DYN (no. 6, 1944), he lent emerging group members such |
|as Motherwell, Pollock, Smith, and Baziotes unprecedented support by |
|including them in the same pages as European modern masters such as  |
|Chagall and Moore.                                                   |
