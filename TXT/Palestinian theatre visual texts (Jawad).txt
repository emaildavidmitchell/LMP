Riad Masarwe’s theatre production of Ghassan Kanafani’s novella Rijal fi al-Shams, first staged in Nazareth in 1977. The play was produced in the wake of Kanafani’s assassination by the Israeli Mossad in Beirut in 1972, and the events of Land Day in 1976. Land Day commemorates the general strike organized in the Galilee in protest of expanded Israeli land confiscation policies of Palestinian lands inside the Israeli state. Six Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship were killed by Israeli forces and hundreds imprisoned.
