Boychukysty

The Boychukysty were followers of the Ukrainian monumental painter Mikhajlo
Lvovych Boychuk (1882-1937), who advocated a national Ukrainian artistic
school drawn from Byzantine, Ukrainian medieval, and early Italian
Renaissance sources. They included Ivan Padalka (1894?-1937?); Vasyl
Sedlyar (1889-1937); Ivan Lypkivsky (dates?); Oksana Pavlenko (1895-1991);
Antonina Ivanova (dates?); Manuil Shekhtman (1900-1941); Mykola Rokytsky
(1901-1944); his wife, Sofiya A. Nalepinska (1884-1937); his brother,
Tymofil Boychuk (1896-1922), and others.

Mikhajlo Boychuk was born in Romanivka, now in Ternopil Province in Western
Ukraine. He studied at the Krakow Academy of Arts from 1900 to 1904,
followed by several months at the Munich Academy of Arts in 1905, under the
sponsorship of the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church,
Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky (1865-1944). Sheptytsky, an ardent supporter
of the arts in Ukraine, funded the education of numerous artists from
Galicia to study in Munich and Paris. Boichuks education was interrupted
by conscription into the Austro-Hungarian army in the fall of 1905, where
he served for one year. In spring of 1907, he moved to Paris to continue
his studies, first at the Vitti Academy, then at the Academy Ranson, where
he took classes with French Nabis painter Paul Serusier (1864-1927), a
professor there. While in Paris, Boychuk met his future wife Sofiya
Nalepinska, and other artists, among them Mykola Kasperovych (1885-1938),
Sophie Segno (1890-1971), and Sophie Baudouin de Courtenay (1887-1967), who
shared a similar passion for Byzantine and Early Renaissance art. Together,
they studied medieval painting methods, mosaic, and fresco techniques, in
an effort to replicate the practices of workshop guilds. In 1909, Boichuk
himself showed two paintings at the Salon dAutomne and, in 1910, the group
exhibited together at the Salon des Independants. They adopted the title
The School for the Revival of Byzantine Art and were featured in their
own room with 21 works. Their exhibit received mixed reviews from numerous
art critics  Apollinaire, Louis Vauxcelles, Andre Salmon, Adolf Basler 
as well as Ukrainian sculptor Alexander Archipenko. Lengthy articles based
on the show and interviews with Boichuk appeared in the Lviv press,
describing the Byzantine revival among Paris Ukrainian artists.

Boichuk returned to Lviv with Nalepinska and Kasperovich in 1911, engaging
in restoration work and painting. In 1917, after Ukrainian independence, he
became a professor at the newly founded Ukrainian Art Academy, under the
rectorship of renowned architect Vasyl Krychevsky (1873-1952). Boychuk
taught fresco painting and sought to inspire students to create work that
represented the interests of the masses while drawing from Ukrainian
medieval and folk art, as well as Byzantine and Early Italian Renaissance
sources. In 1919, he painted murals with fellow boychukists for the
Lutske Army Barracks, and, in 1920-22, for three Young Communist clubs,
both in Kyiv. His academic appointment continued after the Academy changed
in 1922 into the Kyiv Art Institute with the new Communist regime. His
following among students and colleagues grew under the governments
Ukrainianization policy, encouraging the study and revival of Ukrainian
culture. In 1925, he helped organize the Association of Revolutionary Art
of Ukraine [ARMU] a national artists organization. Additional monumental
commissions included frescoes for the Farmers Sanatorium of the All-
Ukrainian Executive Central Committee in Odessa (1927-29), Conference Hall
frescoes for the Kyiv Academy of Sciences (1930), and murals for the
Kharkiv Chervonozavodsky Ukrainian Drama Theater (1934-35). All of these
commissions were painted with fellow boychukists. The official
governments tolerance for Boychukism ended with the promotion and then
enforcement of Socialist Realism as the only accepted ideology and style.
Many members of the group were executed, sent to concentration camps or
simply disappeared during Stalins purges. Mikhajlo Boychuk was arrested
and executed in 1937, as was his wife Sofiya Nalepinska. Kasperovych
Sedlyar and Padalka suffered the same fate. Boychuks monumental works were
destroyed after his death.
