Jamal al-Din al-Afghani جمال الدين الافغاني (1838- 1897 )

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838-1897) is considered the ‘father of Islamic modernism.’ As a philosopher, writer, orator, and journalist, Al-Afghani affected Islamic thought from the Indian subcontinent, to Iran and the Middle East. He advocated for national liberation and was the founder of the revivalist movement, which later gave rise to the Muslim Brotherhood. Of Iranian origin, al-Afghani travelled widely, spending time and working in Afghanistan, India, Iraq, Egypt, and Istanbul. His preaching and writings called for a Muslim revival, an abandonment of fatalism, and the application of intellect to work for freedom. He urged students to use journalism as a tool in the fight: to influence minds. He denounced Muslim rulers who opposed reform. He envisioned Muslims being governed in one state, free from western imperialism, and reviving the past glories of Islam. He pioneered an Islamic awakening for Muslims through his writings, teachings, speeches, and political organizations, which sparked anti-imperialist, reformist, and pan-Islamic political activities.

Jamal al-Din al-Afghani is considered the ‘father of Islamic modernism.’ He took great pains to cloak his Iranian origins and identified himself as Afghan, thus the nisba, al-Afghani. No doubt this was to hide his Shi’ite upbringing, which would have presented obstacles for his mainly Sunni audiences and readers. Al-Afghani was more a philosopher than a cleric. He saw Islam through a political light instead of a religious one.



Four of al-Afghani’s Arab admirers – Muhammad Abduh , Jurji Zaidan Adib Ishaq and Rashid Rida – provide biographical details about al-Afghani that ideally fit what he would have wanted others to believe about him. Keddie’s ground-breaking biography confirms his Iranian origins and refers to Abduh’s and Zaidan’s accounts as the standard biography.

Al-Afghani’s studies and travels led him to India, Afghanistan, Persia, Istanbul, Egypt and Europe. While residing in India he wrote and published his The Refutation of the Materialists (1881), a rejection of the ideas of Sayyid Ahmad Khan. This work was later translated by his student Muhammad Abduh and published in Beirut in 1886 as al-Radd ‘ala al-dahriyyin. In Paris, with the assistance of Muhammad Abduh, al-Afghani published al-‘Urwat al-wuthqa’ (The Firmest Robe,1884). This journal earned him a place in French intellectual circles. He was invited to Persia by Shah Nasir al-din to act as his special advisor but al-Afghani’s differences led to his departure. Again, in 1889, al-Afghani was offered the position of grand vizier by the Shah but in 1891, al-Afghani’s criticism of the ruler led to his deportation.





Influence on Egypt

Al-Afghani’s teaching had the greatest impact on the Egyptians. He profoundly influenced Egyptian youth in Cairo and Alexandria. He advocated for constitutional liberties and liberation from colonialist powers. In Cairo, al-Afghani’s students Muhammad Abduh and Sa’ad Zaghlul emerged as heroes of Egyptian independence. Abduh became the chief mufti of Egypt, while Zaghlul, an Egyptian revolutionary, became a leading statesman and Egyptian Prime Minister.



Al-Afghani spent the last years of his life attached to the Ottoman court of Sultan ‘Abd al-Hamid II. His efforts, speeches, and writings urged Muslims to rebel against the imperial powers, to unite and to reform. Only toward the end of his life was he a true advocate of pan-Islamism. He was a major Muslim reformist, who established a bridge to modernity, between tradition Islamic culture and the new scientific knowledge of the West.
