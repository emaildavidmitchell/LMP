KINUGASA, Teinosuke (1 January 1896- 26 February 1982)

Kinugasa Teinosuke was a Japanese actor and film director, most famous for
his experimental films of the 1920s and art-house classics of the 1950s.
He started as a specialist in oyama female roles, a tradition carried over
from Japanese theatre to film, and turned to directing as the convention
faded in the 1910s and 1920s.  After directing films for major film studios
Nikkatsu and Makino, Kinugasa went independent in 1926 with the New
Impressionist Film League, his collaboration with members of the New
Impressionist School of modernist writers led by Yokomitsu Riichi and
Kawabata Yasunari.  Kinugasa produced his most famous film, the
experimental, avant-garde Kurutta ichipeiji (A Page of Madness, 1926), from
a script by Kawabata and others.  Despite its secure location in global
film history, A Page of Madness was not a financial success, and Kinugasa
began working for Shchiku, at first producing noteworthy films such as
Jujiro (Crossroads, 1928) that, while experimental in nature, never again
rose to the same level of high-modernist abstraction.  Kinugasa had a long
career at Shchiku and then Daiei as a director of period dramas.  His
films Yukinojo henge (An Actors Revenge, 1935) and Jigokumon (Gate of
Hell, 1953), both starring frequent Kinugasa collaborator Hasegawa Kazuo,
are representative of his middle and late career.  Gate of Hell won a Palme
dOr at Cannes and received an Academy Honorary Award, the precursor
category to Best Foreign Language Film.
