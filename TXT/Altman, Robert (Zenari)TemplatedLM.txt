Robert Bernard Altman (20 February 1925, Kansas City, Missouri–20 November 2006, Los Angeles) was an American director of television, theatre, and, most famously, films, including MASH, Nashville, The Player and Gosford Park. Altman’s films are characterized by satire, social criticism, fragmented storylines, and indefinite endings.

Robert Bernard Altman (20 February 1925, Kansas City, Missouri–20 November 2006, Los Angeles) was an American director of television, theatre, and, most famously, films, including MASH, Nashville, The Player and Gosford Park. Altman’s films are characterized by satire, social criticism, fragmented storylines, and indefinite endings. These encourage consideration of Altman as a modernist (or postmodernist) auteur. Robert T. Self (2002) argues that Altman was among those American filmmakers who in the 1960s and 1970s applied ‘a modernist sensibility’ to genres such as romance (A Perfect Couple (1979)), westerns (McCabe & Mrs Miller (1971)), and science fiction (Quintet (1979)). These films demonstrate modernism’s taste for ambiguity, contradiction, and paradox. They reject the tendency toward resolution and closure typical of genre films. Similarly, The Long Goodbye (1973), Altman’s adaptation of Raymond Chandler’s hard-boiled detective novel of the same name, re-imagines film noir (arguably a modernist mode) and thus raises questions about the stability of genres and the endurance of modernist styles past their historical period. According to Self, Altman’s films of the 1980s and 1990s cease his interrogation of genre but remain committed to ‘the modernist impulses of irony, experimentation, reflexivity, and social critique’ (Self 2002, 103).
