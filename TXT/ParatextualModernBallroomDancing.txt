Images:

1) There are great images of Irene and Vernon Castle from:

Castle, Vernon and Irene. 1914. Modern Dancing. New York: World Syndicate Company. 

http://memory.loc.gov/musdi/240/0039.jpg (Castle Walk, from p. 46)

http://memory.loc.gov/musdi/240/0036.jpg (Castle Walk, from p. 42)

http://memory.loc.gov/musdi/240/0030.jpg (Tango, p. 36)



2) There are also great images of Maurice Mouvet in the book 

Mouvet, Mourice. 1915. Maurice’s Art of Dancing. New York: G. Schirmer. I can see the whole book on google books, but I can’t download any pages and the pages with images are not numbered. But there are many great images in this book which might be in the public domain.



3) It would be nice to have an image of Arthur Murray. I think the Arthur Murray International controls all images of him. There are many circulating in books, etc., but I think they would decide which one would be used in this context. I like this one, but they didn’t let me use it when I asked several years ago.
