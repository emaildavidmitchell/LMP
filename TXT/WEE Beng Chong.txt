WEE Beng Chong (1938- )

Wee Beng Chong is a Singaporean artist with a highly respected reputation in both painting and sculpture.  Trained at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and L’Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France (1964-69) Wee’s art practice explores both Western and traditional Chinese art styles reflecting an international view of art practice.  Prior to studying in Paris, in 1964 Wee became a founding member of the Modern Art Society, an organisation that did much to promote public understanding of contemporary art in Singapore. On his return to Singapore Wee helped popularise sculpture in the early 1970s, at a time when few Singaporean artists were working seriously in this medium. Much of his work favours realism and abstraction and Wee often composes works in mixed-media. He is also a practitioner of Chinese traditional ink painting, calligraphy and seal engraving. In 1979 Wee received the Cultural Medallion for artistic excellence from the Singapore Ministry of Culture. He is active in many arts organisations and was head of the Fine Art department at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (1982-89) where he is currently a senior teaching fellow. Wee’s works have featured in many major exhibitions of Singapore art, and he is well represented in public collections.
