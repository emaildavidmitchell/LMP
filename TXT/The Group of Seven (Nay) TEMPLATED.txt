The Group of Seven 

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

The Group of Seven was a group of Canadian landscape painters working in the early 1900s that developed a distinct style of painting tied to the evolution of Canada’s national identity. The group’s work focused on capturing the natural beauty of Canada’s vast wilderness through a self-proclaimed ‘Canadian’ style that evolved following group expeditions into Canadian wildernesses. The original members of the group were Franklin Carmichael (1890-1945), Lawren Harris (1885-1970), A. Y. Jackson (1882-1972), Frank Johnston (1888-1949), Arthur Lismer (1885-1969), J. E. H. MacDonald (1873-1932), and Frederick Varley (1881-1969). The group’s members were based in Toronto, Ontario, and included fine artists, commercial artists and graphic designers who would meet at the Toronto Arts and Letters Club. Tom Thomson (1877-1917) was the group’s spiritual founder, even though he died three years prior to its official formation. Membership would expand in later years to include A. J. Casson (1898-1992), Edwin Holgate (1892-1977), and LeMoine Fitzgerald (1890-1956). Emily Carr (1871-1945) was also associated with the Group of Seven, but was never an official member. The Group of Seven disbanded in the 1930s.

The individual works of the members of the Group of Seven varied, but each member shared similar techniques and stylistic approaches with the common goal of representing the ‘untouched’ Canadian landscape through a uniquely Canadian style. The Group claimed to distance itself from European styles, but references to Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and Art Nouveau are clearly evident in their work. Seeking to develop a distinctly Canadian style, the Group developed a unique, rugged approach to painting. The Group worked directly from nature in challenging physical environments, forcing them to adapt, for instance, to painting in the frigid cold. At the same time, the painters were frequently required to adapt to painting in the modes of travel that afforded them access to deep wildernesses (many works, for example, were created from within a canoe). The ability to produce works quickly yet agilely in these environments provoked a spontaneous form of painting — vast vistas framed by pine boughs were captured on canvases using broad, fast brush strokes followed by thick, bold splashes of colour applied in thick layers without the benefit of preliminary sketches or careful premeditation. The Group of Seven’s work ultimately gained widespread popular support within the art community and Canadian popular culture. Its collective body of work now forms the core of permanent art collections at institutions across the country, including the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection. Contemporary critics have since raised numerous issues about the intentions, methods, and rhetoric of the group, specifically criticising the group’s complete dismissal of the rich artistic and cultural histories of the Indigenous peoples existing in areas that the group confidently labelled as ‘untouched.’
