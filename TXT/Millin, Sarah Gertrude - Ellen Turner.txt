MILLIN, Sarah Gertrude, (March 19 1888- July 6, 1968)

Born of Lithuanian Jewish parentage, Sarah Gertrude Millin grew up amongst the diamond diggings in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. After her first novel, The Dark River (1919), Millin published a further sixteen novels in a career spanning five decades. The publication of God’s Step-Children (1924) cemented her international reputation. Millin’s oeuvre includes two autobiographies, a six-volume diary and copious non-fictional works on South African concerns. Of these, her biography of diamond magnate Cecil Rhodes (1933) was particularly acclaimed. Central to Millin’s fiction is the depiction of both urban and rural South Africa and her work embodies many of the opinions of her English-speaking, white, middle-class, South African contemporaries. The South Africa of Millin’s novels is represented with a stark and pessimistic realism. While Millin was a prolific and popular writer during her lifetime, posthumously her reputation has suffered because of the recurrence of themes of racial purity and abhorrence of miscegenation in her writings. J.M. Coetzee’s 1980 article has had a particularly significant role in the establishment of (still scant) scholarly criticism on Millin. Despite the inherent dangerous racial ideologies in her work, Millin nevertheless holds an important place in women’s literary history in South Africa.
