Lahham, Rafiq

Born in Damascus in 1932, Rafiq Lahham went on to become a pioneer in
Jordans modern art movement. His body of work is characterised by a
diverse approach to choice of style, media, and subject matter. Working in
oil, gouache, watercolor, collage, printmaking, and silk screens, Lahham
depicts portraits, landscapes and cityscapes, Arabic calligraphy, and semi-
abstract compositions. During the sixties, Lahham was among the first
artists in Jordan to incorporate calligraphy into his compositions and also
one of the first painters to experiment with complete abstraction. Laham is
considered, along with Muhanna Durra, to be a member of the first
generation of Jordanian artists to receive government scholarships to train
abroad. He studied at Ente Nationale Addestramento Lavoratori Commercio and
St. Giacomo Instite in Rome, graduating in 1962. He continued his studies
in painting and etching at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New
York. Upon his return to Amman, Lahham worked as a cultural advisor for the
Ministry of Tourism until his retirement in 1995. He is a founding member
of the Artists Association. He lives and works in Amman.
