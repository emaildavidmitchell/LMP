Biography

John Tavener is an English composer.  He studied at the Royal Academy of
Music in London, where his composition teachers were Lennox Berkeley and
David Lumsdaine.  His earliest success was the cantata The Whale, first
performed at the inaugural concert of the London Sinfonietta in 1968.  This
was followed by Celtic Requiem in 1969, and both works were recorded on the
Beatles Apple label.  Tavener began teaching at Trinity College in 1969.

Tavener is extremely prolific.  Amongst his most significant later
compositions of the next decades are ltimos Ritos (1972), the opera
Thrse (1973-6), Akhmatova: Requiem (1979-80), Ikon of Light (1984),
Orthodox Vigil Service (1984) and Akathist of Thanksgiving (1986-7).  The
huge unexpected success of The Protecting Veil for solo cello and orchestra
(1987) brought his music to the attention of a wider audience than ever
before.  Subsequent large-scale works of significance are Resurrection
(1989), Apocalypse (1993), Fall and Resurrection (1997), Total Eclipse
(1999), The Veil of the Temple (2001), Laila (2004), Sollemnitas in
Conceptione Immaculata Beatae Mariae Virginis (2006) and Requie (2007).
Tavener was knighted in the 2000 honours list.

Style

Taveners early engagement with modernism was later very publicly rejected,
but his absorption of the late serial style of Stravinsky in the 1960s has
had a profound effect on his subsequent development.  In such works as The
Whale and Celtic Requiem, the use of collage and quotation more than
balances the quest for ritualized objectivity, and the attraction towards
sentimentality that has also been a constant in Taveners work is clearly
audible in the Messiaen-influenced lushness of In alium and Celtic Requiem.

Quotation of earlier music continued to be of interest to Tavener, and was
a particular feature of the vast ltimos Ritos and the song cycle Canciones
Espaolas (specifically Bach and 16th century Spanish songs).  The
spiritual and musical crisis that Tavener underwent during the composition
and disastrous premire of his highly dissonant, expressionistic opera
Thrse was resolved by a change of religious orientation (he was received
into the Orthodox Church in 1977) and a gradual change of musical style.

Works written during this period, such as Kyklike Kinesis (1977), Mandelion
for organ (1981) and Prayer for the World (1981) in spite of their
connection to the world of Orthodox spirituality and their increasingly
spare textures, continued to be constructed in much the same way as the
music of the preceding years, using twelve-note melodic writing and a high
level of dissonance.  With the lengthy Akhmatova: Requiem (1979-80), the
twelve-note technique had become much looser and more instinctive, but it
was with shorter, unaccompanied choral works such as Funeral Ikos and The
Great Canon of St Andrew of Crete (both 1981) that Tavener discovered a
new, essentially tonal, simplicity and made a decisive break with
modernism, connecting this change of vocabulary to his ever-deeper interest
in liturgical and spiritual texts from the Orthodox Christian tradition,
such as the Prayer to the Holy Spirit by St Symeon the New Theologian (949-
1022), set in Ikon of Light (1984).  This said, the use of modal elements
from Eastern chant traditions has tended to be within the context of
diatonic tonality.

While Taveners more recent interest in non-Christian religions, including
Hinduism (The Veil of the Temple, 2001, Laila, 2004), Buddhism (Shnya,
2002) and Islam (The Beautiful Names, 2003, Two Hadiths, 2007) and his
return to  Roman Catholic liturgical structures (Sollemnitas in Conceptione
Immaculata Beatae Mariae Virginis, 2006 and Requiem, 2007) has brought a
renewed lushness, and a more saturated harmonic style, to his work, his
rejection of modernism has remained constant.
