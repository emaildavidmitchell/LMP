RON RICE (1935-1964)

Josh Guilford (Brown University)

Ron Rice was a central figure in the 1960s American avant-garde cinema.
His films are closely affiliated with beat literature given their emphasis
on improvisation and spontaneity, their engagement with themes such as
social marginality, drugs, travel, and sexuality, and their documentation
of artistic subcultures in San Franciscos North Beach, Mexico, New York
City, and Venice, California.  As is suggested by his use of the neologism
Dazendada to describe his work, Rice was influenced equally by the
historical avant-garde (Dada, Soviet Cinema) and distinctly late-modern
American cultural developments such as free jazz and the popularization of
Zen Buddhism. At the same time, the comedic dimensions of his films have
invited comparisons to silent slapstick cinema.

Rice only completed three works before his death by pneumonia at the age of
29: The Flower Thief (1960), Senseless (1962), and Chumlum (1964). An
additional feature, The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man (1963/82), was
assembled posthumously. While The Flower Thiefs rejection of narrative
coherence and professionalism made it a cornerstone of the New American
Cinemas rebellion against classical aesthetics, Rices subsequent
explorations of irrational montage, psychedelic imagery, and sexual
debauchery contributed to the formation of a more explicitly
countercultural Underground Film movement in the mid 60s.  His works
feature celebrated performances by underground actors such as Taylor Mead,
Jack Smith, and Winifred Bryant.
