Born into a family of Syro-Lebanese origin in Alexandria, Egypt, Georges
Sabbagh is an Egyptian painter of the cole de Paris. He started painting
at the Acadmie Ranson in Paris in 1910, where he was introduced to Flix
Vallotton and Maurice Denis, who had a significant influence on his work.
During the First World War, he enrolled in the British army and on his
return to France he married the art historian and activist Agns Humbert.
By 1930, he received the French nationality. Sabbagh assimilated the
experiences of the Nabis, the Cubists and the Fauves, while searching for a
new form of realism. In that sense, together with painters such as Yves
Alix, Jules-Emile Zingg and Henry de Waroquier, he belonged to what the
critic Jean Cassou called the sacrificed generation.
