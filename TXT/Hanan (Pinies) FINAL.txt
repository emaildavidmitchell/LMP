l-Shaykh, Hanan (1945-)



SUMMARY



												Hanan al-Shaykh (Ḥanān al-Shaykh حنان الشيخ) is one of the most important voices of contemporary Arabic literature. She has written essays, novels, short stories and several plays for theatre. She was born in Lebanon and began to publish in a newspaper when she was only 14. After her college studies in Egypt she returned to Lebanon, but in 1976 she had to leave the country due to the civil war. At first she lived in Saudi Arabia, but since 1982 she has lived in London with her family. The war and its consequences, sexual repression, and the hypocrisy in religion all are important components of her writing. Her novels have been translated into 20 languages (among them English, French, Spanish and Korean). Many of her novels have achieved major success among both the critics and the reading public, for instance The Story of Zahra (1980), Women of Sand and Myrrh (1988), Beirut Blues (1992), This is London (2000), and The Locus and the Bird: My Mother’s Story (2009). Hanan al-Shaykh also revisited the popular One Thousand and One Nights (2011).

MAIN ENTRY



												Hanan al-Shaykh was born in Beirut, to a Muslim Shii family. She received a classical education at a girls’ schools in Beirut and then studied at the American College in Cairo (1963-1966). She returned to Lebanon, where she worked as a journalist for several newspapers and for television. During the Civil War she lived in Saudi Arabia from 1976 to 1982 and then moved to England, where she currently lives. She began to write essays when she was teenager, but soon felt more comfortable writing fiction. 



												Al-Shaykh published The Story of Zahra (1980), a novel set in the Lebanese Civil War, at her own expense due to the censorship in Lebanon. It was the first of her works to attract international attention. Zahra (who symbolizes Lebanon) is an ugly girl trying to survive in the middle of the war. After some terrible episodes in her short life, including divorce and several abortions, Zahra falls in love with a sniper, a desperate gesture that ends in tragedy. Beirut Blues (1992), also about the war, is written as a set of letters addressed to real and symbolic recipients in an attempt to find sense and humanity in the middle of chaos and destruction.



												Women of Sand and Myrrh (1992), set in an unspecified country in the Middle East, explores the everyday life of four women, their ambitions, sexuality, and intimacy in an oppressive male chauvinist society. In The Locus and the Bird. My Mother’s Story (2009) al-Shaykh traces the biography of her mother, an independent woman who decided to leave her family to follow her own way in life.



In her last works (Only in London and the Virgins of Londonistan) she explores Arab society in England, depicting the ghettos in which they live and the difficult position of those who are caught between Eastern and Western identities. In fact, after more than thirty years living in Europe, she has declared that she is no longer able to write about Arab countries.



Her style is innovative and has created a new way of showing contemporary Arab life in plain language, revealing women’s fight for freedom, the right to choose their own sexuality, and religious expression, all while expressing a continuous feeling of dislocation and solitude.



Hanan al-Shaykh has received many literary awards. For instance, Women of Sand and Myrrh was chosen as one of the 50 Best Books of 1992 by Publishers Weekly and Only in London was preselected for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in 2002. In France, where her work has been very well received, The Locus and the Bird was awarded the Prix du Roman Arabe in 2011.
