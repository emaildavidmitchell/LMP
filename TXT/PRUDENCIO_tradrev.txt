Cergio Prudencio
Camila Juarez
La Paz, Bolivia. 11-3-1955. A composer, director, researcher,  and  teacher.
He studied at the Bolivian Catholic University, the Cursos  Latinoamericanos
de Msica Contempornea (CLAMC, Latin American Contemporary Music  Courses),
and the Orquesta Nacional Juvenil de Venezuela  (Venezuelan  National  Youth
Orchestra).  His  most  influential  teachers  were  Carlos  Rosso,  Alberto
Villalpando, Rubn Vartan, Corin Aharonian, and Jos Antonio Abreu.  Hes
been a resident composer in Australia  (1996),  Germany  (2001),  and  Italy
(2007), and holder of a  fellowship  of  the  Guggenheim  Foundation  (2008-
2009), and he was also given assignments by the Perth  Festival  (Australia,
1996), the Pro Helvetia Foundation (Switzerland, 1997),  the  Donaueschingen
Musiktage Festival (Germany, 1999), the TaG  Ensemble  (Switzerland,  2001),
the Buenos Aires Contemporary Music Festival  (2003),  and  the  Klangspuren
Festival (Austria, 2009).

Prudencios musical work sets a dialogue between Andean and European  avant-
garde traditions; in this sense, he co-founded in 1980, and has  since  been
director  of  the  Orquesta  Experimental  de  Instrumentos  Nativos  (OEIN,
Experimental Orchestra of Indigenous Instruments), an  ideological,  musical
and pedagogical project that asserts the Aimara  music  tradition  from  the
Bolivian Altiplano by means of a contemporary expression.  OEINs  programme
links local materials and forms to procedural  techniques  from  avant-garde
contemporary music. In this respect, Prudencio says  in  his  book  Hay  que
caminar sonando (2010): the freedom of sound, the structural sense  of  the
timbre, and time as a space are, among others, concepts  I  learned  in  the
context of 20th  century  avant-garde  music,  but  symptomatically  I  also
discovered those categories in other way also within pre-Hispanic  music  of
the  Americas,  where  they  had  been   already   existing   probably   for
millenniums (2010: 95). Prudencios reflections on Latin  American  musical
identity undertakes a strong social commitment  through  projects  like  the
OEIN and its Programa de Iniciacin a la Msica (PIM,  Initiation  to  Music
Programme). He stated that we are not Latin Americans just because we  were
born  or  live  in  Latin  America.  Our  identity  implies   a   state   of
consciousness and an active position,  or  at  least  a  survival  instinct
(2010: 58). The OEIN has achieved a wide  international  renown,  performing
in  Latin  American  countries  (Uruguay,  Argentina,  Brazil,  Mexico   and
Colombia). and  European  and  Asian  nations  as  well  (Germany,  Austria,
Switzerland, Australia, Italy, and Korea).
The   cataloguing   of   Prudencios   repertoire    and    its    stylistic
characterization made here were taken from several  Graciela  Paraskevadis
texts the inner notes from various cds and her article Imaginemos  msicos:
Cergio Prudencio, caminante altiplnico (2011).
Cergio Prudencio composed ten works  for  the  OEIN,  being  the  first  the
forerunner La ciudad (1980), followed by Trptica (1986), Cantos  de  piedra
(1989), Cantos de tierra (1990), Los peregrinos  (1995),  Cantos  meridianos
(1996),  Uyariwaycheq  (1998),  Cantos  crepusculares  (1999),  Otra  ciudad
(2005), and  Cantos  ofertorios  (2007-2009).  The  orchestra  is  basically
composed by wind instruments from  the  Bolivian  Altiplano  (a  variety  of
tarkas, reed flutes, sikus, fifes, mohoceos and pinquillos) and  percussion
(Italaque bass drums, wankaras,  chapacas,  and  chajchas,  among  others).
Every Prudencios piece for the OEIN shares the  interest  on  the  sonorous
dimension  (timbre,  attacks,  registers,  textures,  types   of   emission,
dynamics, and articulation) and the articulation  in  a  circular  time.  La
ciudad, based on a poem by Blanca Wiethchter, and dedicated to the city  of
La Paz, Bolivia, was the cornerstone in  OEINs  career,  which  started  in
1980. It was composed for four groups of  wind  instruments  of  the  Aimara
musical tradition (quenas,  pinquillos  and  fifes;  tarkas,  mohoceos  and
sikus) and percussion (bass drum and wankara), with a  structure  of  twelve
sonorous units of different length, which become anti-teleological by  means
of a continuity and break logic. The idea is  to  generate  structures  that
are installed in  a  static  time,  which  are  modulated  by  a  repetition
procedure in connection with the Altilplanos dual principle of  the  arca-
ira, that is the alternation of sounds between two musicians regarding  the
configuration of music (Prudencio 2010: 118). On this subject,  within  his
series of five  Cantos  (Chants),  his  piece  Cantos  de  tierra  (Earth
Chants, 1990) clearly deals with the temporal conception from the  Bolivian
Altiplano cultures; Cantos crepusculares  (Twilight  Chants,  1999)  deals
with  the  texture  of  the  materials  by  means  of  reiterative  cyclical
procedures, and the structure  in  Cantos  ofertorios  (Offertory  Chants,
2007-09) is based on the offers made by the Aimara priests.  This  religious
thinking is also present in  Uyariwaycheq  (1998),  through  two  texts,  an
Andean and a Christian one. Through this dialectics  between  opposites  and
complementaries, Prudencio sets the specificity of  Latin  American  History
of the last five centuries.

His  catalogue   also   includes   pieces   for   traditional   instruments,
electroacoustic and mixed ones, as well as music for audiovisual  and  radio
displays. He wrote fourteen soloist works, with mbitos  (1998,  for  piano)
as a highlight: it is articulated on  different  segments  with  tempi  that
either  expand  or  contract,  to  which  descriptive  indications  such  as
calming down, like a heart beat,  with  emotion,  like  singing  with
sighs, and like waves are added.  According  to  the  author,  Horizontes
(2001), for piano, is  structured  in  contrasting,  non  continuous  units,
through  which  the  intention  is  to  create  atmospheres   avoiding   the
conventional expressiveness of  the  piano.  In  both  pieces  the  arca-ira
principle is used, together with silences, ostinatos, and a structure  built
upon expressive sections. Umbrales (1994, for piano)  and  Solo  (1994,  for
violin), together with Paisaje con habitantes (1994, for violin,  cello  and
double bass), belong to a trilogy composed for the film Sayariy (1994),  and
the three pieces for piano of Figuraciones  (2006),  Esta  distancia  (2006,
for cello), and Transfiguraciones (2006, for string quartet)  were  composed
for the film Saber que te he buscado (2006), both directed by Mela Mrquez.

He also composed  chamber  works  for  traditional  formations  like  string
quartets for which his first production, Gestacin (1976), was  meant,  and
later on Transfiguraciones (2006), several instrumental ensembles,  a  trio
and many duets one of them, No te duermas, nio (for voice and  piano)  was
registered in 2007. He wrote four pieces for percussion  alone  Perpetuidad
(1978); Juegos imaginados (1985-1987), A la sombra  de  una  higuera  (1996-
1997), and Rastros/ Vestigios/ Sombras (2010), for  prepared  marimba,  and
his electroacoustic production starts with Awasqa (1986),  characterized  by
the austerity of the sound of the tube of  a  sikus  and  the  play  between
sound and silence. However, most of his work in this area  starts  in  2005,
with Titanias y  Gestuales  (2005),  where  each  part  stands  out  with  a
particular timbre, generally artificially manipulated. Eriales  (2006)  also
explores the timbral dimension of sound, and is  articulated  through  three
sections: the first and the third ones with a linear time,  the  second  one
with a static and spatial time.
