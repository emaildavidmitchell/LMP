Platonov, Andrei (, , 1899-1951)

Born into the family of a railway worker, Andrei Platonovich Klimentov
began publishing poetry and essays soon after the 1917 revolution, adopting
the pseudonym Andrei Platonov, which was based on his fathers first name.
Educated as an engineer, he worked extensively in hydrological projects in
Voronezh and Tambov provinces. In 1927, Platonov published a debut
collection of stories Epifanskie shliuzy (The Locks of Epifan) and moved to
Moscow to pursue a career as a writer, contributing stories, novels, plays,
screenplays and critical essays, most of which were written in an
idiosyncratic style and conveyed an odd view of the world. Though he firmly
believed that his writing furthered the cause of Communism, and though he
enjoyed high esteem among fellow writers, Platonov experienced long periods
of official disfavor and was unable to publish his major works, the novels
Chevengur (1929), Kotlovan (The Foundation Pit) (1930), Dzhan (Soul) (1935)
and Schastlivaia Moskva (Happy Moscow) (1936?). He enjoyed a modicum of
redemption with his stories during World War II and subsequent retellings
of folklore in the late 1940s. His reputation has grown steadily since more
of his works became accessible to readers, a process that began in the
1960s and continues to this day.

Andrei Platonov was an idiosyncratic writer who can be claimed equally by
modernism and by socialist realism. Born into the family of a railway
worker on the dusty outskirts of the south-western Russian city of
Voronezh, Andrei Klimentov (his pseudonym Andrei Platonov was based on his
fathers first name) began publishing poetry and philosophical essays soon
after the 1917 revolution in the spirit of the Proletkult movement, which
sought to create a new, working-class aesthetic. His writing career was
interrupted by his education and work as an irrigation engineer, although
he also published extensively on technical matters. In 1927 Platonovs
debut collection of stories Epifanskie shliuzy (The Locks of Epifan) was
published and he moved to Moscow to pursue a career as a writer. Over the
next decades Platonov forged a reputation as one of the most sincere and
original voices in Soviet literature, but these very qualities made him a
frequent target of ideological watchdogs, and many of his most significant
writings were published only posthumously, some as late as the 1990s.

Platonovs earliest writings reveal the deep influence of cosmism, a wildly
speculative trend in Russian philosophy exemplified by the works of Nikolai
Fedorov and Aleksandr Bogdanov, often coloured by the philosophical
pessimism of Oswald Spengler and Vasily ROZANOV. Platonovs early work in
fiction bears the clear imprint of the neo-baroque style of Boris PILNYAK,
with whom Platonov collaborated on a story and a play in 1928. The result
of these disparate influences was an odd view of the world communicated in
an idiosyncratic style, often via hard-done-by characters marked by a kind
of holy foolishness. Platonovs first run-in with officialdom came after
his story Usomnivshiisia Makar (Doubting Makar) (1929), which presents
a peasants dumbfounded view of socialist Moscow. Platonov was subject to
an outright ban for several years after his 1931 documentary sketch Vprok.
Bedniatskaia khronika (For Further Use. The Chronicle of a Poor
Peasant), which allegedly attracted Stalins personal ire. With his
uncomprehending characters and ambiguous narratives, Platonov is sometimes
read as a satirist, but he seems to have believed sincerely and ardently
that his writing was a constructive force in the advent of Communism
(though his repeated attempts to win membership in the Communist Party
appear to have been unsuccessful). Nonetheless, his first major novel
Chevengur (1929) was published only in part, and while Kotlovan (The
Foundation Pit) (1930) and Schastlivaia Moskva (Happy Moscow) (1936?)
remained wholly unknown to readers until decades later. None of his many
dramas has been staged; only one of his many screenplays was produced, but
the film (Aina from 1930) has not survived.
      Platonov enjoyed a brief respite in the mid-1930s. In 1937 he
published Reka Potudan (The River Potudan), a collection of new stories,
and in 1938 the central newspaper Literaturnaia gazeta published fragments
of his novel Dzhan (Soul). However Platonov was soon in disfavour again, in
part for his work on the theoretical journal Literaturnyi kritik, the
intellectual leader of which was Georg Lukacs. A collection of critical
essays Razmyshleniia chitatelia (Meditations of a Reader) was prepared for
publication in 1939 but withdrawn at the last minute. Platonov enjoyed a
modicum of redemption with his stories during World War II and subsequent
retellings of folklore in the late 1940s, some of which were published in
book form. His reputation has grown steadily since more of his works became
accessible to readers, a process that began in the 1960s and continues to
this day. Platonov is now widely recognized as one of the major Russian
prose writers of the twentieth century.

Essays (New York: Farrar Straus Giroux)
      Nobel Prize-winning poet Brodsky argues that Platonovs work was an
unmasking of the revolutionary eschatology embedded in the [Russian]
language, typifying the ways in which Platonov has been read as a (willing
or unwilling) dissident against Stalinism.

      A major American critic and philosophical theorist, Jameson argues
that Platonov represents both a problematic survival of modernism and an
intriguing alternative to our postmodern condition.

and the Idea of Revolution (Stanford: Stanford University Press).
      Platt theorizes Platonovs style as a revolutionary grotesque, born of
historical disjuncture and evasive of recognition.

iconic embodiment of an ontological theme of the spirits unsuccessful
