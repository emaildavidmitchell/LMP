Der Brenner was a literary and cultural journal published in Innsbruck by
Ludwig von Ficker, between 1910 and 1954. The journal was closely related
to Karl Kraus influential publication Die Fackel, in Vienna, and during
its early years largely served as a vehicle for its most prominent
contributor, Carl Dallago. During the same period, many important modernist
authors also found broad dissemination through the pages of Der Brenner,
including Else Lasker-Schler, Alfred Loos, and Herman Broch. Most
significantly, the journal championed several figures associated with
German expressionism, particularly the poet Georg Trakl. Der Brenner also
played an important role in the rise of existentialism in the Germanic
world, introducing the writings of Sren Kierkegaard to a wider reading
public, and promoting the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche. Among the many
important subscribers of Der Brenner who had access to these authors in its
pages were Rainer Maria Rilke, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Martin Heidegger,
Franz Kafka, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Martin Buber. From the mid 1920s
onward, the journal took an increasingly theological turn, particularly
under the influence of Theodor Haecker.
