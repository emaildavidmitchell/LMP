JODOROWSKY, Alejandro Prullansky (February 7, 1929–) 

Alejandro Jodorowsky is a versatile film director and extremely prolific writer of Chilean extraction. He is also famous for his comics, poetry, novels, short stories, theatrical plays, as well as nonfiction writings. In the non-Spanish speaking world, Jodorowsky is primarily known as a film director specializing in phantasmagorical, surreal, and psychedelic films. He made his directorial debut in 1968 with a full-length feature film, Fando and Lis, an adaption of Fernando Arrabal’s play of the same title that Jodorowsky had previously directed for theatre. It was his next two films, however, El Topo (The Mole, 1970) and The Holy Mountain (1973) that established Jodorowsky as a unique voice in world cinema. While the former is what might be termed a “psychedelic western,” the latter is a surreal film of spiritual exploration. Both draw heavily, thematically and visually, on various mystical traditions, including Jewish Kabbalah, Christian esoteric doctrines, Buddhism, and Latin American Shamanistic rituals. Beyond their extensive use of symbolism, these films experiment with various cinematic forms, conventions, and genres, and thereby suggest new possibilities for experiencing cinema. Jodorowsky continues to develop his mystical film style, and after a prolong break from directing films, he has recently returned to active filmmaking.
