Obregón & Valenzuela

Obregón, Rafael; Obregón, Jose María; Valenzuela, Pablo

Rafael Obregón, Jose María Obregón and Pablo Valenzuela founded the architectural practice Obregón & Valenzuela in 1944 (Martínez, 1950). In 1982 this firm abandoned its activity in urban and architectural design to create the building company Obreval SA in partnership with Ospinas Cia SA (Constructora Obreval S. A.). From the 1950s until the 1970s, Obregón & Valenzuela conceived around 140 projects, being one of the most prolific firms in Colombia, while leading the dissemination of modern architecture in the country. Their architectural production includes commercial, educational, social, industrial and institutional buildings (Revista Proyectiva). A highlight of their work is a series of private houses, banks, and social clubs built in different cities, such as Bogotá, Barranquilla and Cartagena.

Rafael Obregón González (Barcelona, 1919 – Bogotá, 1976) received an honours degree of Bachelor of Architecture from the Catholic University of America (Washington D.C.) in 1944. In the 1950s he lectured in architecture at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and Universidad de los Andes. He was a member and subsequently president of the Society of Colombian Architects, and an honorary member of the Society of Architects in Chile and Venezuela. It was under his leadership that most of the significant projects of this firm were developed (Neira 292). An exceptional sailor, spear fisherman, boxer and racing car driver, he took advantage of his active social life in securing commissions for Obregón & Valenzuela.



Jose María (Pepe) Obregón Rocha (Bogotá, 1921-1982) also received the degree of Bachelor of Architecture from the Catholic University of America in 1944. He went on to lecture in architectural design at the Universidad Javeriana and Universidad de los Andes. He was a board member of the Society of Colombian Architects, and a member of the executive board of the Panamerican Congress of Architects held in Bogotá in 1968. The quality of the projects led by him was a determining factor in the recognition of this firm. He was also a water-colourist, and staged several individual and collective exhibitions of his works. Unlike his cousin, Rafael Obregón, Pepe Obregón was an introvert and contemplative.



Pablo Valenzuela y Vega (Bogotá, 1920-1954) also held a Bachelor of Architecture from the Catholic University of America. He was a member of the Society of Colombian architects, and the firm’s manager until his early death.



Obregón & Valenzuela pioneered the introduction of international trends, by adapting universal principles to the local context (Arango and Martínez 135-6), The remarkable architecture of this firm demonstrates an interest in relating the architectural object to the urban dynamic, through generous openings in the ground floor of tall buildings. In their lower-scale architecture, they achieved a connection between the interior space and the surrounding landscape, by using free-standing plants, crystal walls, and exuberant interior gardens (LLanos et al. 2012).
