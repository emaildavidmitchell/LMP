Mun Sen, Yong (1896-1962)

Yong Mun Sen was a prominent watercolourist born in Sarawak, Malaysia. Known for his prodigious skills in watercolour, Mun Sen is acknowledged as one of Malaysia’s pioneer artists. His watercolour landscapes and depictions of life are visual histories of British Malaya and his subject matter ranged from tropical scenes, local architecture to farming imagery. A self-taught painter, his residence in Singapore and subsequent permanent relocation to Penang created fruitful artistic relationships with artists based in both locations. Notably, Mun Sen went for plein air trips with his peers in Singapore and Penang, an art activity not previously practiced by local artists and most suitable for watercolour productions. Active artists in Penang before World War Two also held gatherings at Mun Sen’s photographic studio. This group of artists formed the Penang Chinese Art Club (1935) with Mun Sen serving as Vice President. He also contributed to the formation of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Singapore (1938). As Tan Chong Guan has written, local and foreign patrons collected Mun Sen’s watercolours, including the Governor-General of British Malaya, Malcolm MacDonald. Mun Sen was nationally recognised with exhibitions in The National Art Gallery of Malaysia and also the State Museum of Penang, both in 1972.
