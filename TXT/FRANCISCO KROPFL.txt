Francisco Krpfl
Laura Novoa

Francisco Krpfl is an  outstanding  Argentinean  composer  and  researcher.
His work as a pedagogue through the development of  several  generations  of
Latin American  composers  is  amply  recognized  as  well  as  his  intense
activity in the diffusion of  20th  Century  music  through  the  Agrupacin
Nueva Msica, (New Music Group), founded by Juan Carlos Paz, of whom he  was
a  follower.   Specialized  in  electroacoustic  music  and  a  pioneer   in
composition with electronic  media,  in  1958  he  founded  the  Estudio  de
Fonologa Musical (EFM)  at  the  University  of  Buenos  Aires,  the  first
laboratory of  its  kind  in  Latin  America.   He  subscribed  to  integral
serialism, an orientation he spread and applied in an original and  personal
manner in his works.
He explored the expressive potential of the human voice both  in  his  works
for voice and as an instrumental  accompaniment  such  as  electroacoustics,
amongst which Orillas (1988) became a paradigmatic work,  and  which  earned
him the Magistre Prize at Bourges, France, in 1988.  He  was  president  of
the Argentine Federation of Electroacoustic Music and  judged  international
competitions of electroacoustic music.
Of Hungarian origin and a nationalized Argentine, Francisco Krpfl was  born
in Tamisoara (Rumania) in 1931 and came to  Argentina  with  his  family  in
1932.  He initiated his musical  studies  with  Hungarian  teachers  between
1940 and 1947.  His early compositions with a free atonal  discourse  reveal
the influence  of  the  Second  Viennese  School  (Schnberg,  Berg,Webern).
Msica para clarinete y flauta (1951) was the  first  piece  composed  under
the tutelage of Juan Carlos Paz, with whom he  studied  composition  between
1948 and 1953. Afterwards they remained in touch through the  activities  of
diffusion of the works of the Agrupacin Nueva Msica.
Although Krpfl began to employ the dodecaphonic  technique  in  his  second
piece of the Dos piezas lricas para piano) (1949)  and  in  Tres  canciones
(1951), his first entirely dodecaphonic pieces are the Tres  Piezas  Fciles
(1952).  To this same period belong the Cuatro  canciones  de  Aldo  Maranca
(1952) for voice, flute and clarinet, the third piece  being  based  on  the
rhythmic organization  techniques  of  Pierre  Boulez.   Inspired  by  Anton
Webern, he wrote Variaciones para  piano  (1953),  his  first  serial  piece
(rhythm, pitch and intensity) and  subsequently  reworked  in  the  Cuarteto
mixto  (1953) for clarinet, mute trumpet, viola and piano.
The years between  1956  and  1958  are  definitive  for  understanding  the
development of Krpfls ideas as well as that of all his subsequent  output.
The technical principles of integral serialism were  transmitted  to  Krpfl
by Pierre Boulez in a series of meetings of the two in Buenos Aires in  1954
and he began to apply with  his  own  take  in  Una  cancin  para  Bartono
(1955), and then in Msica 1956 (1956) for solo  clarinet,  and  in  a  more
organic fashion in Msica  1957  (1957)  for  soprano,  guitar,  vibraphone,
piano and percussion.  Although in Msica 1957, Krpfl considered  the  idea
in an organic,  integral  form  for  the  first  time,  the  first  strongly
systematic organization of all the parameters  becomes  concrete  in  Msica
1958 for piano.
Krpfl  was  acquainted  with  the  earliest  electronic   compositions   of
Stockhausen, Berio and Maderna  and  in  1958  he  wrote  the  prologue  and
translated together with Guillermo Lcke of Elektronische Musik by Eimer  et
al., which was the first edition in Spanish of the Cuaderno I of Die  Reihe.
 That same year he founded  the  Estudio  de  Fonologa  Musical,  which  he
presided  until  its  closure  in  1973,  also  started   composition   with
electronic media with Ejerccio de Impulsos  and  Ejercicio  Electrnico  de
Texturas (both 1959), Ejercicio de Ruido Blanco  (1960).  Dialogos  I  y  II
(Dialogs I and II) as well as Mutacin I (1969) reveal Krpfls keenness  in
finding an integral form  through  the  continuous  modulation  of  distinct
dimensions of the sound material.   Msica  para  Sintetizador  (1970),  the
last piece to  be  done  at  the  EFM,  was  composed  with  a  synthethizer
controlled by voltage, designed and built at EFM, and  completely  novel  to
Latin America.
During this period he also worked with traditional  instruments  and  became
interested in the relationship between image and  sound.   Dimension  (1960)
for two guitars, piano, percussion, is the music for a short movie  feature,
in which he applied  the  principles  of  the  time  formants  technique  of
Stockhausen together with the principle of  wave  interference  of  Joseph
Schillinger.  He also produced the music for the  audiovisual  Flash  Gordon
in the Frozen Kingdom (1968) presented at the  Di  Tella  Institute  in  the
context of the Bienal Internacional de la Historieta.
 Following this, Krpfl drew away from serialism and started  to  experiment
with some of the  aesthetics  current  in  the  mid  sixties.   He  explored
analogic notation in Msica 1966 (1966), graphic  scores  in  Variations  on
December 1952 (1966) of Earl Brown and alleatory techniques in  Esquemas  de
Improvisacin Grupal  (1967/69).
While  teaching  between  1967  and  1971  as  Professor  of  the  Chair  of
Electronic music and acting as director of  the  laboratory  of  the  Centro
Latinoamericano  de  Altos  Estudios  Musicales  (Latinamerican  Center   of
Musical Higher Studies) (CLAEM) of the Di Tella  Institute,  he  contributed
to give shape and organicity for the teaching and composition of music  with
electronic media.  His influence has been  major  in  the  generation  of  a
valuable corpus of foundational pieces of Latin American composers.
When CLAEM shut down and its equipment was transferred   to  the  Centro  de
Investigacin   en   Comunicacin   Masiva,   Arte   y   Tecnologa    (Mass
Communication,  Art  and  Technology  Research  Center)   (CICMAT),   Krpfl
continued teaching to young composers interested  in  electroacoustic  music
whilst also directing the Contemporary Music  Department  between  1972  and
1977 and there produced Tnicas y Giros (1973) and  Pequeos  Seres  (1973),
his first work with a synththizer (an ARP one).
He was awarded the Guggenheim fellowship (1977  1978)  and  before  leaving
for the United States and Europe he composed  Tro  1977,  Msica  1974  for
flute and piano and, together with  Gustavo  Beytelmann,  the  film  musical
score for Quebracho (1974).  At Columbia-Princeton  Universities  laboratory
he produced three electronic pieces, Nocturno  (1977),  Scherzo  (1977)  and
Msica para Percusin (Music for percussion) (4 channels)  (1997).   On  his
return to Buenos Aires he explored into music for computers with  Ejercicios
para computadora (1979).
Krpfls teaching work, focused on the analysis and composition of music  of
thetwentieth century, was  intensifiedduring  the  eighties,  same  period
when  his  fundamentals  ideas  aboutrhythmorganizationof   rhythm,   the
micromodes and hexachordal modes were widely spread. At  the  same  time  he
became the  director  of  the  Laboratorio  de  Investigacin  y  Produccin
Musical (Laboratory of Research and Production of Music)(LIPM),  inaugurated
in  1982,  which  reached  international  prestige   through   programs   of
collaboration and exchange with similar institutions in  the  United  States
of America and in Europe.
   A persistent streak in Krpfls music and  verifiable  in,  for  example,
   Tres  Improvisaciones  (1983)  for  flute,  in  Polimonoda  para  cuatro
   instrumentos (1984), Pequeo requiem para una voz (Tiny requiem  for  one
   voice) (1986), Tres poemas de Lorca, Ballet  (1987) and Orillas,  is  the
   mutation of the material,  the  transformations  of  which  reorient  the
   formal direction of the work.
   Between 1987 and 2005 Krpfl received  commissions  from  Cologne  Radio,
   Germany (WDR), from the French republic, from INA-GRM, LIEM and  IMEB  to
   compose  pieces  of  electroacoustic  music,  amongst  which  it  can  be
   mentioned Metrpolis Buenos Aires. Temas y Variaciones sobre  una  ciudad
   (1989),  a  sound  picture  of  the  city  of  Buenos   Aires,   Espejo
   Distorsionante (1994), the mapuche indigenous  peoples  trilogy  Vientos
   (1996), Al Sur  (1997) and El Regreso   (2000);  El  pjaro   (1995);  El
   vuelo (2000), Lento come le algue (2005).
   Krpfl Retired  from  institutional  public  activity  in  2006  and  his
   instrumental production has increased as from the year since 2000 as  new
   commissions have been received and  he  has  written  trios  for  various
   groups (Trio 02, Trio 03 and Trio 08), a Quartet  Number  2b  (2006)  for
   strings, flute, French horn and  trumpet,  Divergencias  (2007)  for  ten
   instruments,  Relato  (2006),  for  reciter,  flute.  Clarinet,   violin,
   violoncello.  Amongst his most  recent  works  it  can  be  mentioned  La
   tercera es la vencida (2011), a staged divertimento with lyrics by  Oscar
   Steinberg.
