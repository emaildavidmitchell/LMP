August Strindberg is Swedens most important writer and one of the most
influential dramatists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Along with Henrik Ibsen, the Scandinavian dramatist to whom he
is most often compared, Strindberg transformed modern Western theatre,
inspiring playwrights such as Georg Kaiser, Eugene ONeill, Edward Albee,
Sarah Kane, and Caryl Churchill as well as the film and theatre director
Ingmar Bergman. Strindbergs plays span the naturalism of early European
Modernism as well as symbolism and expressionism. His work in non-dramatic
genres and media includes novels, autobiography, journalism, poetry,
essays, painting, and photography. Outside of Sweden Strindberg is known as
a personality and a playwright who mined his own and others experiences
for his art. The miseries of marriage are central to many of Strindbergs
plays, which underwent radical stylistic changes after a personal crisis in
the mid-1890s. Strindbergs experiments with alchemy and occultism during
this period influenced his later works, which frequently represent dreams,
states between life and death, and the transformability of matter. In the
21st century, Strindbergs plays are mainstays of world drama.

Johan August Strindberg was born in 1849 in Stockholm, Sweden to a middle-
class father and a working-class mother. The historical drama Master Olof
(1872-1877), which he rewrote several times in prose and verse, is the most
noteworthy of his early plays. But it was Strindbergs novel of social
satire Rda rummet (The Red Room, 1879) that launched his career and
Swedens contribution to the Scandinavian Modern Breakthrough. In the play
Frken Julie (Miss Julie, 1888), Strindberg fully developed and theorised
the naturalistic style for which he became famous, though initially his
publisher rejected the play, which was not published uncensored in Sweden
until 1984. Miss Julies kitchen setting emphasizes domestic labour and
class divisions among its three characters: Miss Julie, the daughter of a
Count; Jean, the Counts favourite servant; and Christine, the cook. The
plot builds to Julie and Jeans sexual intercourse, which reverses the
power dynamic between them: whereas in the first half of the play Julies
social class places her above Jean, in the second half Jean has an edge
over Julie, who is now a fallen woman. Thus the play is about sex and
gender as much as class. The preface to the published version of Miss Julie
outlines fundamental principles of Strindbergs naturalist dramaturgy, in
which the characters lives are determined by social class, heredity, and
environment. This naturalism is influenced by mile Zola (1840-1902);
however, Strindberg departs from Zola in his contradictory emphasis on the
constraints of genre as well as social and biological forces: he subtitles
the play, A Naturalistic Tragedy. Strindbergs preface to Miss Julie also
recommends changes in theatre and staging practices such as eliminating act
divisions (which break the theatrical illusion), doing away with footlights
(which hurt the actors eyes and distort the appearance of their faces),
and adopting cropped settings that encourage the audience to imagine the
set extends beyond the stage frame. If Miss Julie is Strindbergs most
performed play, the preface is his most read essay on the development of
modernist theatre.
      Strindberg often used his own and others lives as source material for
his writing. Strindbergs first marriage to Siri von Essen, a noblewoman
who left her first husband to marry Strindberg and become an actress, was
dissolved in 1891. Following his second marriage to the Austrian journalist
Frida Uhl in 1893, Strindberg entered a period of personal torment known as
his Inferno crisis. During this period Strindberg did not write plays;
instead, he wrote about photography, alchemy, and spirituality for French
occultist publications. Strindberg documents his experiences during this
period, including paranoia and hallucinations, in the novel Inferno (1897),
which was published in the same year his marriage to Frida was annulled.
The Inferno crisis was a turning point for Strindbergs dramatic style,
which subsequently emphasized dream states and spirituality without
abandoning the material and social concerns of his earlier work. The most
influential of Strindbergs post-Inferno plays, Et drmspel (A Dream Play,
1901), follows Indras Daughter, the daughter of a god, who comes to Earth
to experience human life and struggle. The plays form is based on
disjointed dream logic and represents similarly incoherent characters.
Indras Daughter, full of pity for the human condition, occupies many roles
as she navigates and ultimately abandons the human world of drudgery and
suffering. A Dream Play questions the possibility of meaningful human
action and, in so doing, influenced twentieth-century movements such as
surrealism and the Theatre of the Absurd. From 1901 to 1903 Strindberg was
married to Harriet Bosse, a twenty-two-year-old actress who inspired and
acted in several of Strindbergs plays. Bosse also inspired Strindbergs
Ockulta dagboken (Occult Diary 1896-1908), in which Strindberg imagines
their relationship as a series of psychic, erotic assaults.
      In 1907 Strindberg partnered with August Falck (1882-1938) to found
the Intimate Theatre in Stockholm. The theatre was a small space
specifically devoted to staging Strindbergs plays. Strindberg wrote five
chamber plays, so named for their intimate scale and association with
chamber music, for the theatre: Ovder (Thunder in the Air, 1907), Brnda
tomten (The Burned House, 1907), Spksonaten (The Ghost Sonata, 1907),
Pelikanen (The Pelican, 1907), and Svarta handsken (The Black Glove, 1909).
The chamber plays, particularly The Ghost Sonata, greatly influenced
modernist and postmodern theatre; however, during the Intimate Theatres
three-year lifespan Strindbergs earlier naturalist work proved more
popular with audiences. Despite and because of the continuing controversies
associated with Strindbergs writing and personality, he was awarded an
anti-Nobel prize of 50,000 kr raised by public subscription Maurice
Maeterlinck (1862-1949), who Strindberg admired, was awarded the
Nobelbefore his death in 1912.
