Mussolini, Benito (1883-1945)

Known as Il Duce (the Leader), the son of a Marxist blacksmith, Benito Mussolini was the ruler of Fascist Italy (1922-1943). A master of populist rhetoric, editor of the socialist newspaper Avanti! (1912-1914), Mussolini shaped the fascist movement as a party leader before rising to state power with his October 1922 March on Rome. He invaded Ethiopia in a brutal war for a new Italian Empire (1935-1936), aided Franco’s Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), and fought on the side of Nazi Germany in the Second World War (1940-1945). His fascist ideology made use of ideas offered by Italy’s ‘philosopher of fascism’, Giovanni Gentile (1875-1944), and manifestos written by the founder of Futurism, poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944). Mussolini’s personality cult influenced dictators such as Adolf Hitler and Francisco Franco, and at times earned the admiration of Winston Churchill (http://bit.ly/NC3LSy) and Franklin Roosevelt (Schivelbusch 31). On April 29, 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed, his body gruesomely displayed (http://bit.ly/Q0oqav). His legacy has spawned fascist movements throughout the world, from Oswald Mosley’s (1896-1980) English Blackshirts to Pierre Gemayel’s (1905-1984) Christian Phalange in Lebanon.
