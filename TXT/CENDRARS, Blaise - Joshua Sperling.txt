CENDRARS, Blaise (September 1, 1887-January 21, 1961)


Blaise Cendrars (born Frdric-Louis Sauser) was a Franco-Swiss poet,
novelist, journalist, filmmaker and explorer. Although his career spanned
many decades, Cendrars is now best known for his involvement in the
Parisian avant-garde just prior to and following World War I. After the war
he wrote La Fin du monde filme par l'Ange Notre-Dame (1919), the first
poem to assume the form of a screenplay. As with many other French
modernists, Cendrars was an early cinephile. He collaborated with Abel
Gance on La Roue (1923) and his essay LABC du Cinema (1926) adopted a
rapturous, millenarian tone in relation to the new medium. All indications
suggest that we are heading towards a new synthesis of the human mind,
Cendrars wrote, a new humanity, and that a breed of new men will appear.
Their language will be cinema. In its combination of media theory and
messianic sociology, Cendrarss ideas anticipated the theories of Marshall
McLuhan. In the 1930s, Cendrars travelled to Hollywood to report on the
American dream-factory for the French press. His dispatches, collected in
Hollywood: Mecca of the Movies, betrayed a less utopian, more sardonic
appraisal of the American entertainment industry and its attendant culture
of spectacle and fame.
