Ahmed Nawar (1945 – )



Born in el-Shin in the Gharbia Province of Egypt, Ahmed Nawar received his bachelors of fine arts from Faculty of Fine Art at Helwan University in Cairo in 1967. Following his graduation, Nawar was called for service in the Egyptian military and was deployed to the Suez border during the War of Attrition. His experience during the war effected him deeply and would find expression in his later artworks. In 1971, Nawar traveled to Spain and received a second degree in graphics from the San Fernando Academy in Madrid in 1974, as well as a degree in mural painting and doctorate equivalent in painting in 1975. As a painter, sculpture and graphic printmaker, Nawar’s work focuses on the interplay of linear and organic forms, often integrating mathematic or technological imagery. In the 1980s, Nawar was a key member of the Mihwar (Axis) Group, an artist collective focused on the relationship between unity and individuality in art. In 1982, Nawar founded the Faculty of Fine Art at Menia University. He served as the faculty’s dean and graphics department chair until he was appointed head of the Egyptian Ministry of Culture’s Sector of Fine Arts in 1988. In recognition of his contributions to the arts, the State awarded him the Egyptian State Order of Arts and Science, First Class in 1979.
