Virago Press

Virago is a British publishing company founded in 1973 by Carmen Callil,
primarily to endorse womens writing and increase awareness of womens
literary history. Inspired by the womens movement, the name Virago and the
bitten apple logo suggest the power of courageous, outspoken females, and
subversive knowledge. Elaine Showalters A Literature of Their Own (1977)
influenced the Virago Modern Classics series which reissues books by
overlooked or underappreciated writers. Launched in 1978, this series
became the hallmark of the brand and a key to its success. The imprint
includes Dorothy Richardson, Rebecca West, Radclyffe Hall, Vita Sackville-
West, H.D., Gertrude Stein, Djuna Barnes and other innovators of modernist
literature. Viragos reprints of womens fiction have contributed to the
scholarly reappraisal of the New Woman and other aspects of gendered
modernism, demonstrating the presss impact on literary criticism and
modernist studies.
