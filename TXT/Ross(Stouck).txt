Ross, (James) Sinclair (1908-1996)

Sinclair Ross was a founding figure of Canadian literature. His novel, As For Me and My House, and short stories, including “The Lamp at Noon” and “The Painted Door,” have been widely recognized as defining accounts of life in early- to mid-twentieth century Western Canada. Ross’ work both evokes a modernist context through its focus on the ambiguities of first person narration, and initiates a nationalist discourse through its depiction of small-town Canadian landscapes and communities. As For Me and My House has been described by Margaret Atwood as “archetypally” Canadian, while fellow Western writer Margaret Laurence credits Ross with showing her that “novels could be written here.”

     James Sinclair Ross was the youngest of three children born near Shellbrook, Saskatchewan to Peter Ross and Catherine Foster Fraser Ross. His parents separated a few years after his birth and Ross remained with his mother, a situation that eventually necessitated him leaving school to support them both. Ross worked at the Royal Bank for forty-three years, in Saskatchewan, Winnipeg, and Montreal. After the publication of As for Me and My House (1941), a psychological study of a minister and his wife in small town Saskatchewan, Ross hoped to become a professional writer, but public indifference and his personal obligations made this impossible. He joined the Canadian Army in 1942 and spent the war in London. His masterful short stories, published in Queen’s Quarterly between 1935 and 1952, were triumphs of perseverance in that they were written in the evenings and on weekends for little financial renumeration.   

     Ross’ second novel, The Well (1958), recounts the story of a drifter who arrives to work on a prairie farm, a situation that ends in violence and treachery. After a lengthy, frustrating publication process and poor sales for the novel, Ross regarded his writing career as a failure. On his retirement from the bank in 1968, Ross moved to Greece, then Spain. During this period, increased interest in Canadian literature and recognition of Ross’s oeuvre encouraged publication of two more novels, Whir of Gold (1970), about a struggling musician in Montreal, and Sawbones Memorial (1974), the story of a retirement party for a small-town prairie doctor.  Sawbones Memorial was a critical success, praised for its innovative use of voice and narrative form. A New Canadian Library edition of Ross’s previously-published fiction titled The Lamp at Noon and Other Stories came out in 1968. 

      In his final years, Ross enjoyed the recognition and encouragement that he had lacked for much of his career. Despite increasing difficulties with Parkinson’s disease which prompted him to return to Canada in 1980, a second collection of his fiction, The Race and Other Stories (1982), was brought out by the University of Ottawa; Ross published a memoir, “Just Wind and Horses” (1988), about his childhood; and he received the Order of Canada in 1992. Ross passed away in Vancouver on February 29, 1996.
