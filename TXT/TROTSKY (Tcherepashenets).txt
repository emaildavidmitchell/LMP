TROTSKY, Leon (1879-1940)

Leon Trotsky, born Lev Davidovich Bronstein, is one of the most controversial figures in twentieth-century history. Along with Lenin, he played a decisive role in the success of the 1917 October Revolution in Russia. A Marxist, a revolutionary, and a talented writer, Trotsky was a principal commander of the Red Army and a major theoretician of world socialist revolution. He viewed violence as an instrument of historical progress. His version of Marxism, which advocated proletarian internationalism and dictatorship, is known as “Trotskyism.” His theory of permanent revolution animated his approach: in order to succeed, the Russian Revolution should inspire similar events in more economically advanced countries.

An outspoken critic of Stalin, Trotsky and his family were persecuted under the Stalinist regime and his role in the revolution was falsified. He was expelled from the Communist Party in late 1927. In 1940, he was assassinated by a Soviet secret agent in Coyoacán, Mexico. Along with his writings, Museo Leon Trotsky in Mexico sheds light on Trotsky’s impact on revolutionary thought, his interests in the arts and sciences, as well as his last years in exile.
