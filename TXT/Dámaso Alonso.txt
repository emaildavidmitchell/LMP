Dámaso Alonso, in full, Dámaso Alonso y Fernández de las Redondas (born Oct. 22, 1898, Madrid, Spain – died Jan. 25, 1990, Madrid, Spain), poet, member of the Generation of ‘27, and a prolific literary critic and scholar whose work, published in ten volumes by Editorial Gredos, had considerable influence in literary and academic circles in Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries in the 20th century. 



Alonso was born in Madrid in 1898 and spent his childhood years in the northern Spanish town of La Felguera (Asturias). After attending a Jesuit high school, he studied law, philology, and literature in Madrid. He was active in the Residencia de Estudiantes, an important cultural centre in the Spanish capital. At the Residencia, he came into contact with poets, artists, filmmakers, and intellectuals, such as Federico García Lorca (1898-1936), Salvador Dalí (1904-1989), and Luis Buñuel (1900-1983). He held teaching posts at universities in Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 1948, he became a member of the Real Academia Española, which oversees the use of Spanish in Spain, and was its director between 1968 and 1982. In 1959, he became a member of the Real Academia de la Historia. 



Alonso’s publications as a scholar and literary critic comprise influential studies on linguistics and literature. Worthy of note is his 1927 critical edition of Soledades [Solitudes] (1613) by Spanish baroque poet Luis de Góngora y Argote (1561-1627). Poesía española: Ensayo de métodos y límites estilísticos (1950) is perhaps Alonso’s most influential scholarly work. This study has undergone numerous editions and has been translated into several languages. He also wrote for literary magazines such as Revista de Occidente and directed the Revista de Filología Española. He translated James Joyce’s modernist novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, in 1926. 



His early poems, gathered in Poemas puros. Poemillas de la ciudad (1921) and El viento y el verso (1925), represent pure poetry and embody a clash between art and reality. Oscura noticia, published in 1944, is a collection of poems written before and after the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). His post-war poems mark a break with pure poetry. Hijos de la ira [Children of Warth] is a complex work that presents an anguished poetic voice in the face of social and cosmic injustice. Alonso himself described this work on several occasions as “un libro de protesta” [“a protest book”]. After 1944, Alonso’s poetry takes on an existential tone, exploring the meaning of life and the world in Hombre y Dios (1955), Gozos de la vista (1981), and Antología de nuestro monstuoso mundo (1985). Gredos publishes in 1992 his complete literary works in Verso y prosa literaria, and, in 1993, eighteen of his early poems appear in Album. Versos de juventud. Alonso received the Premio Miguel de Cervantes, Spain’s highest literary honour, in 1978.
