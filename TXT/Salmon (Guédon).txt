Salmon, Andr.

1881-1969.
French poet and art critic. Associated with Guillaume  Apollinaire  and  Max
Jacob, he also developed a long-lasting friendship with Pablo  Picasso.  His
first literary endeavour was inspired by pictorial Cubism,  and  promoted  a
new lyricism: Crances (1905-1910) mixes fragments of  Symbolist  aesthetics
with Modernist features, such as the  insertion  of  non-literary  materials
within the text. Carreaux (1918-1921) shows more clearly a  Cubist-inflected
ars poetica as it puts together collage-like  fragments,  making  a  liberal
use of juxtaposition techniques and  multiple  voices  while  coupling  free
verse with alexandrine meter. He is also well-known for  his  art  criticism
in support of the Bateau-Lavoir generation of  artists    in  particular,
through the journal Le Festin  dEsope  and  with  his  pamphlets  La  Jeune
peinture franaise  (1912),  La  Jeune  sculpture  franaise  (1918),  Lart
vivant (1921).  Apollinaire  composed  the  famous:  Pome  lu  au  mariage
dAndr Salmon at the occasion of his wedding with Jeanne Salmon  in  1909.
His  anthologies  have  been  illustrated  by   Derain,   Marie   Laurencin,
Modigliani and Picasso. He was  awarded  in  1964  the  Prix  de  lAcadmie
franaise de posie.
