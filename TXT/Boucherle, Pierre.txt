Boucherle, Pierre (b. 1895 Tunis, Tunisia—d. 1988 Six Fours les Plages, France) 



Pierre Boucherle was a French artist born in Tunisia. After World War I, he became a student of André Derain in Paris. His experiences with the École de Paris in Montparnasse influenced his subsequent relations with artists in Tunis. Boucherle organized successive groups of French, Italian, and Tunisian artists under the French Protectorate: the Groupe des Quatre in 1936, the Groupe des Dix in 1947, and the École de Tunis in 1948. He was the president of the École de Tunis until Tunisian independence in 1956 and was succeeded by Yahia Turki. Boucherle painted landscapes, still lifes, and nude figures. He designed three tapestries executed in the Ateliers Tabard in Aubusson, France, initialising an important link between the École de Tunis and French modern tapestry. In 1950 Boucherle served on a government committee that oversaw the decoration of Protectorate buildings under the 1% law. This committee established an institutional partnership between the colonial artisanat and the École des Beaux-Arts. Boucherle designed the decorative programs for the Lycée Carthage in Tunis and the Maison de la Tunisie in Paris between 1951 and 1954. He taught painting at the École des Beaux-Arts from 1958 until 1967. Boucherle left Tunis for France in 1978.
