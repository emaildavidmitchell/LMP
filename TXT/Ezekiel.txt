Born to academic Marathi-speaking, Jewish parents of the minority Bene-
Israel persuasion, Ezekiels existence within cosmopolitan Mumbai (then
Bombay) rendered complex his poetic sensibility. After a Bachelors degree
in Literature atWilson College, Bombay in 1947 and some political
engagement with M. N. Roys Radical Democratic Party, he sailed to
Englandfor further studies in 1948. As a student of philosophy at Birkbeck
College, London, he published his first volume of poetry, A Time to Change
(1951). This transit generated enduring exploratory tropes of journey,
pilgrimage, departure, and venture in his poetry. His early oeuvre has
affinities with the work of T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, Ezra Pound and Rainer
Maria Rilke.

After returning to India, Ezekiels literarycareer was divided between
editing, reviewing, teaching and writing poetry. His commitment to art and
literature is reflected in his ten years of broadcasting (1952-62) on these
subjects on All India Radio. He was associated in an editorial capacity
with esteemed journals like Quest, Imprint, Poetry India, The Illustrated
Weekly of India, The Indian P. E. N., steadily contributing more than 500
discerning book reviews, besides essays as art critic for The Times of
India. Ezekiels valued position as a forthright critic is borne out by his
hard-hitting yet deeply reflective rubbishing of V. S. Naipauls
controversial perspective on India in Naipauls India and Mine,(1965).
His own cultural and ethnic commitments to this dark and wounded India are
rendered evocatively in his poem, Background, Casually in the unassuming
passion of: My backward place is where I am.

A foundational voice in Indian English poetry, Ezekiel vitally influenced a
whole generation of poets like Dom Moraes, Gieve Patel and Eunice de Souza.
His early verse, in A Time to Change (1951), Sixty Poems (1953) and The
Third (1958) shows the poets continuous and frequently ironic
introspection on issues of home and belonging, of the self, the body and
the world, of urban desolations and redemptive love, of prayer, penitence
and poetry.

The ten poems of The Unfinished Man (1960) have a confessional quality,
melding critical self-examination with the mode of prayer, self-parody at
failure with a higher artistic aspiration toward a free mythic vision of
primal innocence.

Ezekiels The Exact Name (1965), with its title and epigraph from Juan
Ramn Jimnez, numbers among its twenty poems some well-anthologized pieces
like Poet, Lover, Birdwatcher, Paradise Flycatcher and Night of the
Scorpion.

Hymns in Darkness (1976) includes a series of eight poems entitled Very
Indian Poems in Indian English that mimic the lilt of Indian speech
cadences and parody the frequently flawed usage of what is called Standard
English. A hybrid form of the language colloquially referred to as Babu
Angrezi is used to render ironically the usage of English by the Indian
middle classes.

Ezekiels unflinching poetic exploration of the interior landscapes of his
spiritual, carnal and aesthetic dilemmas is powerfully maintained through
dramatic tonal colouring, stark emblematic imagery and a conscious metrical
craftsmanship that never calls attention to its own formal manoeuvres.

Nissim Ezekiel received national honours of the Sahitya Akademi award in
1983 for his poetry collection, Latter-Day Psalms, and the prestigious
Padma Shri Award in 1988. After a prolonged battle with
Alzheimer'sdisease,Ezekieldied in Mumbai, on 9 January 2004.
