Anton (Friedrich Wilhelm von) Webern (18831945)

Kathryn Bailey Puffett

Webern was one of the three principal composers of the Second Viennese
School. Probably Arnold Schoenbergs first private pupil and a devoted
lifelong friend, he was one of the founders in 1918, along with Schoenberg
and Alban Berg, of the Society for Private Musical Performances in Vienna,
a society dedicated to the furtherance of the understanding of contemporary
music whose concerts were attended by invitation only. He was also an
immediate convert to Schoenbergs twelve-note technique, which was
announced in 1923; in fact it is clear that Webern was experimenting with
ideas of this sort already in 1911. Webern was destined to become a model
in the 1950s to composers such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen
and other integral serialists of the Darmstadt school, who eagerly seized
upon his strict adherence to twelve-note rows (from 1926 onwards) and his
careful organisation of rhythm and dynamics, which led to an total
serialism in the 1950s and 1960s of which he would almost certainly have
despaired. He was also a conductor of considerable merit, though the Second
World War more or less put an end to both his conducting career and the
performance of his music.

Anton von Webern was born in Vienna but spent most of his childhood years
in Carinthia, returning to Vienna in 1902 to enter university, where he
received a doctorate in musicology in 1906. The most important instruction
of his life, however, began in the autumn of 1904, when he became a pupil
of Arnold Schoenberg. Schoenberg and the pupils in his composition class
would become important figures in the artistic upheaval that took place in
Vienna in the early twentieth century. Along with many other artists of the
time they tended to see themselves  and this was particularly true of
Webern  as islands of truth surrounded by mediocrity and hostility.
      Although a large number of very early tonal works exist in
manuscript, only two of Weberns works that he felt to be deserving of opus
numbers were composed during the years that he was Schoenbergs pupil, the
op. 1 Passacaglia and the a cappella chorus Entflieht auf leichten Khnen,
op. 2, both written in 1908 and both still anchored in tonality. The form
that his compositions took changed three times: in 1908, when he abandoned
tonality altogether and began to write the very brief atonal,
pointillistically disposed aphorisms of opp. 311, probably the music for
which he is best remembered; in 1914, when he turned to song-writing; and
in 1926, when he became secure in the twelve-note technique and for the
first time began to compose successfully in extended instrumental forms.
His musical style, however, changed very little in spite of these changes
of approach structurally. Two identifying features of his early music that
might be singled out as particularly characteristic of his later style as
well are his special fondness for the interval of a semitone and its
inversion and the various octave expansions of both, and his pointillistic
scoring, with its resultant kaleidoscopic textures. Lines are angular and
disjunct, using extremes of both register and dynamics in close proximity.
Rhythm and metre are never prominent, the one tending to be complex and the
other often almost completely obscured. A multiplicity of instrumental
effects  harmonics, pizzicato, spiccato, non-vibrato, col legno, am
Griffbrett and am Steg in the string parts; fluttertongue in the flutes;
mutes used liberally in all parts  results in an eerie sound world in
which timbre frequently predominates over pitch, and silence assumes a
place on a par with both.
      The pieces of opp. 711 (191014) represent the extreme of Weberns
aphoristic period, with many of the movements lasting for only eight or
nine bars. The fourth piece of op. 10 consists of only twenty-eight notes,
two of which are expressed as a trill. The dynamics of op. 7 no. 3 never
rise above ppp. In the third piece of op. 11, which is played entirely at
ppp and pp, the cello has eight notes and the piano only a three-note
melody and three chords, all in or below the bass clef. The three tiny
movements of this opus, thirty-two bars long in total, take approximately
two minutes to perform.
      The small number of notes in some of these pieces is probably their
most striking feature when compared to the music of other composers of the
time, and can be seen as a direct manifestation of the crisis that the
Viennese triumvirate created for themselves in abandoning tonality. Webern
said later of his experience when composing the op. 9 Bagatelles (six
little pieces of  ten, eight, nine, eight, thirteen and nine bars length):
I had the feeling that when all twelve notes had gone by the piece was
finished . . . . In my sketchbook I wrote out the chromatic scale and
crossed off the individual notes.
      The next six works with opus numbers, written over the years 191426,
represent another change of direction: all are songs, in which text is used
as a way of expanding once again a style that had reached its optimum
brevity with op. 11.
      Schoenberg formally introduced his new technique of composition in
the early 1920s. Webern began experimenting with this way of writing in the
eight songs of opp. 1719 (19246); his first fully developed twelve-note
piece was the op. 20 Trio for Strings (1928), which also represented a
return to instrumental writing after thirteen years in which the only works
he had felt to be worthy of opus numbers and publication were songs.
      All the instrumental movements from op. 20 onwards make reference to
traditional forms: binary and ternary forms, sonata, rondo, variations, and
on occasion some combination of two or more of these.
      Two things that consistently shape Weberns twelve-note writing are
his propensity for canon and his fascination with symmetry. The op. 21
Symphony represents a convergence of these two preoccupations, being a
brilliant display of simultaneous horizontal and vertical symmetries
(palindromes and mirror inversions) unfolding through a series of double
canons. Imitation in Webern is seldom direct: it is usually in inversion,
sometimes in retrograde, both of which result in symmetry.
      With the Anschluss came a list of degenerate art that included
Weberns name; from 1938 the publication and performance of his music was
banned in Germany and Austria, though performances continued in America,
Britain and Switzerland. Of his last four works only the op. 28 Quartet was
published during his lifetime, by Boosey and Hawkes in London.
      At the end of March 1945 Webern and his wife, with their eldest
daughter, Amalie, and her children, fled their home in Mdling on foot to
join their other two daughters, in Mittersill, in the mountains near
Salzburg, to get away from the constant bombings in Vienna; Mdling fell to
the Russians six days later. The final irony came when Webern was shot dead
while smoking a cigar after dinner on the veranda of his daughter
Christines house four months after the war had ended, the victim
indirectly of his son-in-laws black-market activities.
