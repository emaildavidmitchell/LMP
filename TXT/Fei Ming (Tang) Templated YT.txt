Fei Ming (废名) 1901 – 1967

Feng, Wenbing 冯文炳

Fei Ming was an important contributor to Chinese modern literature between the 1920s and 1940s. He was born to a wealthy and traditional family in Huang Mei county, Hu Bei Province, Mainland China, in 1901. He received Chinese traditional education in “si shu” (私塾, a private school), studying四书五经 (The Four Books and Five Classics) and other Confucian classics. In 1922, he entered Peking University and began to write poetry and fiction. Two years later he was transferred to the English department at Peking university and studied British literature. Meanwhile, he became a member of语丝社 (‘Yu Si She’), a literary group founded in 1924 by Lu Xun (鲁迅; original name Zhou Shuren, 周树人) and Zhou Zuoren (周作人, the younger brother of Lu Xun) to produce Chinese modern literary works for their journals—《语丝》(Yu Si) and《耕耘 (Geng Yun). In 1925, Fei Ming published his first short story collection《竹林的故事》 (The Stories of the Bamboo Grove). Between 1925 and 1932, he published his first long novel 《桥》(Bridge) in serial form in《语丝》. Between 1928 – 1932, he published two short story collections《桃园》 and《枣》, and two long novels《桥》(Bridge) and 《莫须有先生传》.

Between 1925 and 1932, he published his first long novel 《桥》(Bridge) in the serial form in《语丝》. 



In 1925, Fei Ming published his first short story collection《竹林的故事》 (The Stories of the Bamboo Forest). The stories in this collection render the simple yet vivid life of characters from lower classes. This collection made him known to the general public and literary circles (Lu Xun and Zhou Zuoren), and it inspired a new literary trend of depicting the individual life and family stories in simple, rural settings (Native Soil Fiction,乡土小说). Between 1925 and 1932, the serial publication of his first long novel《桥》 (Bridge) in《语丝》 (Yu Si) further demonstrates his serious attitude towards novel-writing. 



Due to the political turbulence at Peking University in 1927, Fei Ming lost his chance to continue studying English literature. With the help of Zhou Zuoren, he found a teaching position in a private high school and spent the second half of 1927 in a rural village (Chen 4). Fei Ming returned to the university in 1928 and continued to be a voracious reader of Shakespeare, Thomas Hardy, and Anton Chekov. After his graduation in 1929, he stayed at Peking University to teach Chinese literature. Between 1928 and 1932, he published two short story collections《桃园》 and《枣》, and two long novels《桥》(Bridge) and 《莫须有先生传》. In 1947, as a sequel to 《莫须有先生传》, an unfinished auto-biographical novel 《莫须有先生坐飞机以后》 was published in serial form in 《文学杂志》 from Volume 2, Issue 11, to Volume 3, Issue 5. Since 1949, Fei Ming mainly published miscellaneous essays on the new aesthetics of creative writing in the new political and social environment. He died in 1967.
