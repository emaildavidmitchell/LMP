KOFI, Vincent Akwete KOFI(1923-74) was born in Odumasi-Krobo, Ghana.
After training at Achimota College, which had the first and foremost art
department in West Africa, he continued his studies at the Royal College of
Art, London (1952-55), and Columbia University, New York (1959). While in
New York, he learned metal casting and, with the assistance of the Harmon
Foundation, produced a film on bronze casting. He taught at the Winneba
Teacher Training College (1961-69) and was Head of Fine Art, College of
Art, (KNUST), Kumasi, (1969-74). He was a member of the Ghanaian delegation
at the First World Festival of Negro Arts, Dakar, 1966. In 1971 he visited
India at the invitation of the Government. His early influences were his
Krobo environment, his artistic father, the Presbyterian minister James
Kofi (1890-1976), who made drawings and teaching aids for Nature Study
classes. In his middle period he drew inspiration from his days at Achimota
College (c. 1945-51), where the pervasive atmosphere of optimism and hope
for a new Africa fired Ghanaian nationalism and the independence struggle.
Kofi believed that he could fuse lessons from the history of modernism in
the arts, creatively and objectively, only by an immersion in his
Ghanaian heritage. His sculptures, Awakening Africa (1959-60) and
Blackmans Stoicism (1964), highlighted Pan-Africanism, and the
decolonisation process that was spreading across Africa.

highlighted Pan-Africanism, and the decolonisation process that was
spreading across Africa.

In his late works he explored bold figural concepts such as the lens-
shapedakuabahead and ringed neck of Akan sculptural traditions and
notions of spirituality. HisOkyeremang(1964, University of Ghana),of 1964
belongs to a trilogy of figures: the dancer, the hornblower and the drummer
that Kofi referred to as the holy trilogy. (Amegatcher 1991: 16). That
Kofi leftThe Hornbloweroutside Nkrumah's rest house, Peduase Lodge, to be
eaten by ants after the coup d'etat in Ghana in 1966, shows his awareness
that a sculpture is made for a particular time and a particular place, and
not for a connoisseur's collection or a museum vault... (Grobel: 1975).

Kofi gained wide international recognition through creating what he called
world art. Rhoda Woets notes that Kofi achieved a calibre of world
art [...] by understanding and artistically interpreting local
traditional customs. . (Woets 2010: 146).Kofi died aged 51. James Kwegir
Aggreys and Kwame Nkrumahs Pan-Africanist ideals motivated Kofi to
formulate a distinctive Ghanaian approach, based on an understanding of
Ghanaian art, to re-define a modern African identity.
