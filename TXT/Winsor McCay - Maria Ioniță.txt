McCAY, Winsor (b..1867-1871, or 26 September 1869, Spring Lake, Michigan  or
Canada; d. 26 July 1934, Brooklyn, New York)

Winsor McCay (born Zenas Winsor McKay) was an American  graphic  artist  and
animator, best known for his Art  Nouveau-inflected  landmark  comic  strips
Little Nemo in  Slumberland  (1905-1914;  1924-1926),  Little  Sammy  Sneeze
(1904-1906) and Dream of the Rarebit Fiend (1904-1925)  and  his  pioneering
cartoon shorts Gertie the  Dinosaur  (1913)  and  How  A  Mosquito  Operates
(1912) and Bug Vaudeville (1921).

McKays early comic strips are notable  for  their  meta-humour,  exploiting
the idiosyncrasies of their medium: little Sammys apocalyptic sneezes,  for
example, would often demolish the panel borders of the last few frames.  His
indisputable masterpiece, Little Nemo, is a colorful extravaganza  depicting
the elaborate dreams of the title  character  and  makes  extensive  use  of
cinematic  techniques  like  close-ups  and  cross-cutting,  elongating   or
broadening panels to accommodate the lumbering gait  of  an  elephant  or  a
beds impossibly spindly legs.

McCays animation displays the same innovative spirit,  albeit  without  the
use of color and stunning detail  of  Little  Nemo.  With  their  remarkably
precise lines, shorts like the landmark Gertie  the  Dinosaur  (depicting  a
brontosaurus puppy-like playfulness), How a  Mosquito  Operates  (in  which
the greedy insect explodes from  overeating)  or  Bug  Vaudeville  (animated
insects perform circus acts against photorealistic backgrounds) are  studies
in movement, testing the new mediums potential. Their  sparse,  sketch-like
appearance contrasts pleasantly with McCays naturalistic representation  of
weight and volume, the smooth sense of  movement,  and  the  precise  timing
achieved through the pioneering use of keyframe animation  and  registration
marks.
