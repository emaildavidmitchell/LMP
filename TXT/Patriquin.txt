Patriquin, Donald (1938-)

Jeremy Strachan



Known chiefly for contributing to choral repertoire in Canada, Donald Patriquin was born at Sherbrooke, Quebec, and studied composition as a teenager with Jean Papineau-Couture, and later in Montreal with Istvan Anhalt and in Toronto with John Weinzweig. Patriquin’s prolific catalogue of work includes expanded tonal settings of texts by Shakespeare (A LOVER AND HIS LASS, 1968), Henry David Thoreau (REFLECTIONS ON WALDEN POND for choir, violin, cello and piano, 2000), and William Blake (SONGS OF INNONCE for choirs, harp, and flute, 1984). Main compositional activities have focused on arranging folk songs from around the world, especially various regions of Canada. Representative of these are SIX SONGS OF EARLY CANADA (1980) and SIX NOËLS ANCIENS (1982), which are frequently performed. Patriquin’s many compositions for children’s choir make use of non-lexical sounds in imitating the soundscape, drawing on the timbral, percussive, and expressive possibilities of voices. Of his non-vocal works, HANGMAN’S REEL for fiddle and string orchestra, commissioned by the Grand Ballets Canadian (1978) remains one of the most significant, and assembles gigs, reels, airs and other vernacular dances into a thirty-minute suite. Issues of cultural awareness, humanitarianism, and global peace provide thematic foundations for Patriquin’s music after about 1985.
