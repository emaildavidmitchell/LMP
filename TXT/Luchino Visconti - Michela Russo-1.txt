Luchino Visconti

Michela Russo (Texas A & M University)

Luchino Visconti (Luchino Visconti di  Modrone,  Count  of  Lonate  Pozzolo.
Milan, 2 November 1906  Rome, 17  March  1976),  was  an  Italian  theater,
opera and cinema director, and a scriptwriter. Visconti's career  begins  in
1936 in Paris, as a director and costume assistant for Jean Renoir. Here  he
gets closer to leftist positions, being in contact  with  some  anti-fascist
militants and leftist intellectuals such as the  writer  and  director  Jean
Cocteau. In the 40s Visconti settles in Rome where he joins  the  Communist
party, to which he will remain bound for the rest of his  life,  and  begins
to collaborate with the journal Cinema. In 1942, with Pietro  Ingrao,  Mario
Alicata and Giuseppe De Santis, he realizes Ossessione, based  on  the  1934
James Cain novel The Postman Always Rings Twice. Although Rossellinis  Rome
Open City (1945) is  generally  considered  to  be  the  founding  movie  of
Italian  neorealism,  for  many  critics,  Viscontis   Ossessione   (1942),
painting a bleak and hopeless world, is a precursor of  the  movement.  In
1945 Visconti works at Giorni di Gloria, a  film-documentary  on  the  Nazi-
fascist occupation of Italy, and in 1948 he  writes  and  directs  La  terra
trema. The latter is an adaptation of Giovanni Vergas  novel  I  Malavoglia
(1881) and is centered on the  story  of  a  family  of  Sicilian  fishermen
echoing Antonio Gramscis concern with the southern question and his  call
for a  new  national  alliance  between  different  popular  sectors.  After
several years dedicated to the theater, Visconti returns to the  big  screen
with Bellissima (1951), the story of a plebian woman whose dream is to  turn
her child into a future star, which, as well as Siamo donne (1953),  a  look
behind the scenes of the film world. With Senso  (1954),  an  adaptation  of
the homonym 1882 novel by the Italian writer  Camillo  Boito,  taking  place
during the 19th century Italian  Risorgimento,  Visconti  distances  himself
from  the  neorealist  path,  combining  realism  and  romanticism.  In  the
following years, Visconti returns to the opera and directs Maria  Callas  in
Verdis La traviata and Bellinis La Sonnambula.  In  1957,  continuing  the
series of great literary adaptations, Visconti realizes  Le  notti  bianche,
inspired in Dostoevskys White Nights. In  1960  he  returns  to  neorealist
features with Rocco e i suoi  fratelli,  the  tragic  story  of  a  Southern
family migrating to Milan in search of fortune. Its  violence,  crudity  and
Viscontis political opinions prompt harsh criticism of the film, but it  is
still awarded the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

After Rocco e i suoi fratelli, Viscontis next major film is  Il  Gattopardo
(1963), which reinterprets Giuseppe Tomasi di  Lampedusas  1958  homonymous
novel about the decline of the Sicilian  aristocracy  at  the  time  of  the
Italian Risorgimento. Winner of the Palme  d'Or  at  the  16th  Cannes  Film
Festival, the film has established Viscontis fame in Europe and the  United
States. In 1965  Visconti  receives  the  Golden  Lion  at  Venice  for  the
nocturnal film Vaghe stelle dellorsa. Inspired by  Sofocless  Electra  and
Gabriele DAnnunzios novel Forse che s, forse  che  no  (1910),  the  film
describes the incestuous relationship of  Giovanni  and  Sandra.  Two  years
later, with Lo straniero (1967), Visconti readapts  in  a  sort  of  oneiric
realism a classic of existentialist literature,  Camus  The  Stranger,  but
the movie does not meet much success.

La caduta degli Dei (1969), which echoes Thomas Manns Buddenbrooks  (1901),
is the first movie of Vicontis German Trilogy; it includes as well Morte  a
Venezia (1971) and Ludwig (1973) and intertwines the themes  of  beauty  and
death. At the end of the shooting of  Ludwig,  the  director  is  hit  by  a
stroke that leaves the left side of his body paralyzed. Despite  his  state,
he directs his  last  two  films,  the  openly  autobiographical  Gruppo  di
famiglia in un interno (1974), and  L'innocente  (1976),  an  adaptation  of
Gabriele DAnnunzios novel of the same title (1892). Visconti will  die  in
the spring of 1976 from a severe thrombosis.
