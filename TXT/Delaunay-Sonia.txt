Sonia Delaunay (14 November 1885, Gradizhsk  5 December 1979, Paris)


         I am attracted by pure colours. Colours from my childhood, from the
                                                                    Ukraine.
                                 Memories of peasant weddings in my country,
 in which the red and green dresses decorated with many ribbons, billowed in
                                                                      dance.

Sonia Delaunay was born as Sarah Stern in Gradizhsk in the  Russian  Empire,
which is now part of the Ukraine. She was  the  youngest  child  of  a  poor
Jewish couple. At the age of five, she was adopted by her  mothers  brother
Henri Terk, who worked as a lawyer in Saint Petersburg,  and  renamed  Sonia
Terk. She then had the opportunity to grow up in an  environment  surrounded
by music and art and to learn several languages.
      Already at a young age, she demonstrated an aptitude for the arts  and
at the age of 18 she was sent to Germany to study at the  Karlsruhe  Academy
of Fine Arts where she developed a strong stylistic  foundation.  After  two
years she decided to move to Paris where she had an active social  life  and
developed a serious academic  career  at  the  Acadmie  de  la  Palette  in
Montparnasse. During this period she was trying to find her own  style,  but
her paintings, such as Finnish Landscape  (1906)  and  Three  Nudes  (1908),
exhibited a perceptible influence of Van Gogh, Gauguin  and  Matisse.  While
in Paris, Sonia Terk met the German art dealer and collector  Wilhelm  Uhde,
with whom she had a marriage of convenience in1908.  Through  Uhde  she  had
her first solo exhibition  and  got  introduced  to  the  Parisian  artistic
elite.
      In 1910 she divorced Uhde and married Robert  Delaunay.  Sonia  shared
with Robert the interest in colors and what they later  called  Simultaneous
Contrast, the idea that contrasting colors create movement  and  take  on  a
life and meaning of their own. However, she never separated  the  decorative
arts from the  fine  arts  and  expanded  her  explorations  of  colors  and
luminosity to new possibilities in objects and  fashion  design.  After  her
son Charles was born in 1911, Sonia deepened her  interest  for  dressmaking
and interior design, creating different pieces of clothing for  the  family,
numerous everyday  objects  of  contrasting  and  complementary  colors  and
painting the walls  of  their  home.  In  1912-13  she  designed  her  first
Simultaneous Dresses, which were mixes of squares and triangles of  taffeta,
flannelette, moir, and corded  silk,  produced  following  the  same  color
research she developed on her paintings of the same  time,  as  one  of  her
first large scale works Bal Bullier.
      During the World War I Sonia and Robert were living between Spain  and
Portugal. In Madrid the couple designed the  costumes  and  stage  sets  for
Sergei Diaghilevs Ballets Russes and Sonia encouraged  by  the  experiences
with fashion design opened the store Casa Sonia  dedicated  to  fashion  and
interior design. When they moved  back  to  Paris  in  1920,  Sonia  started
working closely with  Tristan  Tzara,  producing  the  famous  Poem-Dresses,
words and colors in ever new relationships through body movement. In  1925
Sonia  featured  her  simultaneous  fashion  designs   in   the   Exposition
Internationale des Arts Dcoratifs et Industriels  Modernes,  which  brought
her designs to a wider audience.
      In the 1930s, with the Great Depression, the Delaunays could not rely
only on painting  and  Sonia  had  her  work  divided  between  fashion  and
interior design, the writing of articles  for  magazines  and  projects  for
window  displays.  Some  of  Sonias  best  works  were  showcased  in   the
Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques  dans  La  Vie  Moderne  in
1937.
      After Roberts death in 1941, Sonia organized  retrospectives  of  his
work as a  continuous  tribute  to  his  life.  Only  after  spending  years
fighting to reestablish Roberts artistic  reputation,  by  the  1950s  she
focused on producing and exhibiting her own work again. During  this  decade
she had many exhibitions mainly in France, Italy and  Germany  and  in  1964
she was the first woman artist to have a  retrospective  exhibition  in  the
Louvre.
      By the 1960s she began a very strong friendship with the poet Jacques
Damase, who coordinated one of the  most  important  retrospectives  of  her
work held in the Muse National  dArt  Moderne  in  1967.  And  during  the
1970s Delaunay-Terk received the Lgion dhonneur and  painted  the  poster
for the International Womens Year of UNESCO.
      Sonia died peacefully in her studio at the age of 94 in December 1979.
Her body was buried close to Roberts in Gambais.
