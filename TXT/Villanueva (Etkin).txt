Mara Cecilia Villanueva (1964)

      Born in 1964 in  La  Plata,  Argentina.  Studied  composition  at  the
Universidad Nacional de La Plata, with Mariano Etkin,  where  she  currently
works as teacher in composition and researcher in musical  analysis  focused
on  20th  century  music.  She  is  considered  one  of  the  most   notable
personalities  of  her  generation,   successfully   mixing   research   and
composition.


      Her music is a testimony  of  aesthetic  independence,  distinguishing
itself from that of her colleagues  by  the  originality  of  her  technical
approaches and the  realization  of  very  personal  ideas.  The  expressive
density of Maria  Cecilia  Villanuevas  music  develops  around  a  complex
elaboration of materials, which in some  cases,  coexist  with  elements  of
extreme simplicity. Her music has been performed in the main  festivals  and
new music cycles of  Europe,  U.S.A.  and  Latin  America,  having  received
multiple recognitions, such as the  German  Forum  Junger  Komponisten  1989
(WDR) prize in Kln and the Elizabeth Schneider 2001 in  Freiburg,  as  well
as the Premio de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2003.  She  has  been
the recipient of several prestigious German composer residences such as  the
Akademie Schloss Solitude, Stuttgart (1994/95);  the  Knstlerhof  Schreyahn
(1996) and the Knstlerdorf Schppingen (2003).

In her musical output, each work appears to be  its  own  world,  closed  in
itself, and full  of  tension.  In  general,  the  instrumental  writing  is
decisive in terms of the determination of its constructive  characteristics,
the selection of the sonic material being used,  and  its  relation  to  the
overall form. All of these characteristics are evident  even  in  her  early
works, such as Biribiriloque (1988) for chamber ensemble,  where  the  viola
has a protagonist role, but not due to any  virtuosic  exhibition,  but,  on
the contrary,  because  of  its  lack  of  expressivity.  The  piece  has  a
continuo, in the way of a moto perpetuo, that produces a particular  anxiety
given its incessant quality by step motion (fig.1 and 2). The  end  of  most
of Villanuevas pieces present an unexpected twist.  In  Birlibirloque,  the
constant and invariable presence of the viola  is  suddenly  abandoned  near
the end as the double bass joins  it  in  unison  (fig.  3).  In  a  similar
fashion, the last sonority of  the  work  Escenario  (2007)  for  piano  and
orchestra, is a sustained drumroll, the only in the entire score. Here,  the
usual meaning implied by the drumroll as anticipatory sign of an ominous  or
important event is inverted, turning it into a concluding  gesture  for  the
piece  (fig.  4).  In  Escenario,  Villanueva   implicitly   questions   the
conventional relation  between  soloist  and  orchestra  by  introducing  an
orchestral piano, giving it a function that is  not  simply  accessory,  but
that is intimately related to the actions of  the  soloist.  Both  the  solo
instrument and the orchestra share the same chord materials, just  like  the
orchestral piano and the soloist piano, that is, the basic material for  the
work  is  being  shared  in  equal  manner  by  both  sound  sources,   thus
eliminating a typical characteristic  of  traditional  texturethat  of  the
singular opposed to the plural, thus showing  a  type  of  self-restrain  in
terms of materials and form (fig.5).

In the  string  quartet  Retrato  del  pasado  (2002),  Villanueva  uses  as
starting point fragments from Beethovens op.127 quartet. Using a  principle
that can be defined as magnifying glass  or  zooming  in,  the  fragmentsof
uneven importance in Beethovenare elaborated in such a way that  they  lose
their constructive weight outside of  their  original  context,  and  become
part of a different style which, nonetheless, preserves in  a  distant,  but
effective way, an unmistakable romantic aura.  Beethoven,  as  presented  by
Villanueva, is modified in a natural manner by the passing of  time;  this
way, the historic macroscopic memory, has a direct relation  to  the  memory
of the listener, who remembers by the end of the work  (Beethovens  or  any
other), only fragments that can  be  recalled  in  a   different  sequential
manner to the music being evoked by  the  composer  (fig.6  and  fig.7).  In
Partida  (1996)  for  a  unique  chamber  orchestra  commissioned   by   the
Donaueschinger Musiktage festival, Villanueva uses different  sonic  objects
that are modified throughout the work. These modification, however,  do  not
stop the listener from recognizing the objects in  relation  to  themselves.
The concept of magnifying glass mentioned for Retrato  del  pasado,  appears
here as well, this time dedicated to  very  specific  materials  (glissandi,
specific chords, ostinati,  etc.)  which,  after  each  appearance,  undergo
microvariations.
