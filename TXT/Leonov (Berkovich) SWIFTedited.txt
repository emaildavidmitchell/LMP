Leonov, Leonid Maksimovich (ЛЕОНОВ, ЛЕОНИД МАКСИМОВИЧ) (1899-1994) 



Russian prose writer and playwright, born and died in Moscow. During the Russian Civil War, he volunteered as a soldier and journalist in the Red Army. Appropriating the ornamental prose style and including the skaz type idiolect in his early stories of the 1920s, he turned to the theme of the Revolution, its impact on village life and the theme of the little man in “The End of a Petty Man.” His works established continuity with the Gogol and Dostoevsky traditions, expanding the trope of the little man to the educated class, though adding to it a new animalistic twist. In his novels The Badgers (1924) and The Thief  (1927), he depicted NEP policies and the resistance to the new Bolshevik regime. His novella “Evgeniia Ivanovna” (1935), censored for several decades, portrayed Russian immigration and the yearning for the motherland. Before and during WWII he wrote plays influenced by Socialist Realism. In 1957 his environmental novel The Russian Forest brought him the Lenin prize. In 1967 he was awarded the Hero of the Socialist Labor for his achievements in literature. His last novel The Pyramid, on which he worked for forty years, was published prior to his death in 1994.
