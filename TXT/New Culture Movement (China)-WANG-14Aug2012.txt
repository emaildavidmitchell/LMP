New Culture Movement (China)

The New Culture Movement (Xīn Wénhuà Yùndòng 新文化运动) originated at Peking University during the 1910s. The movement’s ideologies were reflected in the phrase Old China (Jiu Zhong Guo旧中国), referring to a rejection of traditional Chinese culture, especially orthodox Confucianism and conventional gender inequality to promote of western cultural modernity (particularly democracy and science). Key leaders of this movement included Cai Yuanpei (蔡元培) (1868-1940), president of Peking University (1917-1919); Hu Shi (胡适) (1891-1962), scholar, writer and philosopher; and Lu Xun (鲁迅) (1881-1936), a writer and critic. Cultural reforms were expressed in the New Youth journal (Xin Qing Nian《新青年》), established by Chen Duxiu (陈独秀) on September 15, 1915. The movement was largely liberal and idealistic, but experienced a schism when, on May 4, 1919, police were ordered by Chinese authorities to fire upon students in Beijing who were protesting the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. The May Fourth Movement (Wu Si Yun Dong 五四运动), as it is known, marked the formation of a leftist faction that challenged the movement’s Western liberalism.
