Hctor Tosar

Camila Juarez

Tosar, Hctor (Montevideo, Uruguay, 7-18-1923/1-18-2002). A composer,
pianist, director and composition teacher in Uruguay, Puerto Rico,
Venezuela and USA. One of the best known Uruguayan composers of his
generation; his works have been presented in many festivals worldwide. He
started studying piano with Wilhelm Kolischer, harmony with Toms Mujica,
and composition with Lamberto Baldi, and then completed his formation in
USA and France, where he studied composition with Aaron Copland, Arthur
Honegger, Jean Rivier and Darius Milhaud, and orchestral direction with
Serge Koussevitzky, Eugne Bigot and Jean Fournet.

The main characteristic in his works is the compositive principle based on
'groups of sounds', and the searching for musical communication by means of
expressiveness and 'lyrism'. His catalogue includes soloist works, mainly
for piano, as well as symphonic, chamber and vocal works, and also, in his
last period, compositions with new technologies and instruments such as the
synthesizer. In his book about the Uruguayan composer, Corin Aharonin
made a stylistic periodization of his work, stating several periods: the
first one, according to Tosar, is characterized by the use of tonal
procedures that become polytonal, or 'free atonal'; this period includes
various pieces for piano Sonatina n 1 and Danza criolla (1940), and Suite
para piano (1944), among others, musicalization of texts like the songs
for piano and voice En tu alma, Soledad, and Mundo, with a text by Jacques
Desprs (c 1939); the six songs in Seis canciones de El barrio de Santa
Cruz, with words by Jos Mara Pemn (1942), and Solitude, based on a poem
by R. M. Rilke (1943), and also orchestral pieces, among which his first
symphonic work Toccata (1940) stands out directed, like Concertino, for
piano and orchestra (1941), by Lamberto Baldi, with the Orquesta Sinfnica
del Servicio Oficial de Difusin Radioelctrica (Official Radio-Electric
Broadcasting Service's Symphonic Orchestra, OSSODRE).
Between 1946 and 1951 he was a scholarship holder of the Guggenheim
Foundation and the French and Uruguayan governments, in order to continue
his studies on composition and orchestral direction in USA and Paris. He
composed, among others, Sonata para violn y piano (1948), Momento
sinfnico (1949), and Sinfona para cuerdas (1951), one of the most
representative pieces in his catalogue, which was performed in Venezuela,
Mexico and Buffalo, USA as well. That same year he created Oda a Artigas
in honour of the centenary of Uruguay's national hero Gervasio Artigas
birth, a piece for reciter and orchestra, with words by Luis Bausero, and
other pieces and songs for choir, with the outstanding Cinco madrigales
(1956) among them. Salmo 102 (1957), for soprano, choir and orchestra, is a
piece in one movement, highlighted by Tosar for its 'exacerbated lyrism'
and the use of chromatism which, like in the Te Deum (1960), for bass,
choir and orchestra, characterizes the passage towards a wider harmonic
freedom. Invited by Juan Jos Castro, from 1961 to 1966 he was a teacher at
the Music Conservatory of Puerto Rico, and there, based on the total
chromatic, he composed the last of his Cuatro piezas (1961-1963) for piano,
with 'tango rhythm'. The process of change in style materialized in Stray
Birds (1963), for baritone and eleven instruments, inspired on a text by
Tagore, where Tosar used serial procedures with 'groups of sounds' that
replace the harmony, thus creating 'fixed zones in the musical space',
according to the author (in Aharonin 1991: 44).
In the seventies Tosar composed a series of eight Reflejos, for various
instrumental formations. In 1976 he returned to the piano with Tres piezas
para piano, thus beginning a new compositive period, followed by Nmoi and
Ecos (1977), and Sul re (1981), a fundamental piece of the period in which
the repetition of the D note was considered structural by the composer.
From 1979 to 1981 he lived as a composition teacher, first in Venezuela, at
the Simn Bolivar Music Institute, and then at Indiana University, in
Bloomington, USA. In those years he composed, apart from Sul re, the
Concerto for piano and orchestra (1979), Cadencias (1979), for orchestra,
and Trio para caas (1980) as well.
Although Tosar kept on writing instrumental pieces like Cinco piezas
concertantes para violn y orquesta (1987) and Septeto (1989), at the
beginning of the eighties started the last period in his production,
characterized by the timbral exploration with the synthesizer. La gran
flauta (1988), where he used flute timbres, was followed by Msica festiva
(1988), characterized by rhythmical exploration, and Voces y viento (1989),
with moments of improvisation. His last work was Passacaglia sobre el
nombre de Bach (1994), in its version for organ.
