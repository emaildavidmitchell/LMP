Kazuo Shinohara (516/500)


SHINOHARA Kazuo (19252006) was born in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. He
graduated from the Department of Architecture, Tokyo Institute of
Technology, in 1953. That same year, he started his career as an academic
and as a practicing architect, having succeeded in both. To SHINOHARA,
theory and practice were not dissociated and whatever he would conceive in
theory, he took the chance to experiment with in real-life structures.
Academically, he published several hundred articles and books between 1955
and 1990; as an architect, he concluded his first project, House in
Kugayama in 1954 and has seen his last work completed, Kumamoto-kita Police
Station, in 1990. SHINOHARA considered himself an individual housing
architect having built around 40 residences.  In the last few years he
built a few non-residential buildings.

Since it started opening to Western influence in the mid 1850s, Japan had
been struggling to find its own identity. At first, architects started
imitating Western styles, from different historical periods, experimenting
with brick and other unknown materials in Japan; yet, some continued to
favour traditional Japanese architecture and a predominant use of wood.
After 1920 [see JAPANESE SECESSION], architects started claiming their own
individual artistic creativity, considering architecture as a science but
also as art. After the Second World War, in the late 1950s, there was a
shortage of millions of homes in Tokyo and new transportation
infrastructures were in need. The government was interested in finding a
solution as fast and cheap as possible. Still, several architects defended
long-term, instead of short-term, strategies that they felt could
compromise the future, turning the city chaotic. SHINOHARA was among them
and his strategy was an unusual one: domestic architecture. Each residence
and each family would eventually blend in, establishing then, Tokyos urban
landscape. It was an organic process. Says SHINOHARA: For us, individual
housing architects, the city pales and becomes uniform, a place where the
infinite variants of human emotion are banned, its not the city of the
future. Unless we are able to harmonize the wonderful technique with human
emotion to create a rich urban environment, its better to abandon
residential architecture. (3; p.362) SHINOHARA started getting recognition
outside Japan in the early 1980s. Contrary to what is common in modernist
architects (who structure their architecture in urbanism), his emphasis was
on domestic architecture and not in institutional/ social buildings.
Perhaps in this sense, he himself stated: I did not belong to Japanese
Modernism. (2; p.134). Prizes: AIJ  Japan Government (2005); Golden Lion
award  Venice Architecture Beinnale (2010).
