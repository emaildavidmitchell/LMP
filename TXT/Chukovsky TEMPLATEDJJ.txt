|While his literary tastes were wide-ranging, Chukovsky consistently  |
|studied the work of two Russian authors  the writer and playwright  |
|Anton Chekhov, and the poet Nikolai Nekrasov  throughout the course |
|of his life. Chukovsky focused on the aesthetic qualities of         |
|Nekrasovs poetry, which had previously been overshadowed by         |
|discussion of the poets social engagement. As editor of the authors|
|complete collected works, he helped to establish definitive versions |
|of his poems. He received the State Lenin Prize in 1962 for          |
|Masterstvo Nekrasova [The Mastery of Nekrasov] (1953). He served as  |
|the London correspondent for the Odessa Times (1903-04), and later   |
|translated the works of Walt Whitman and Oscar Wilde, among many     |
|other English and American writers. His translations of these authors|
|greatly contributed to their popularity in Russia. He was selected by|
|Maxim Gorky to head the English section of World Literature          |
|Publishers in 1918, during which time he composed general guidelines |
|for literary translators, later published as Iskusstvo perevoda [The |
|Art of Translation] (1936), and then Vyssokoe Iskusstvo [A High Art] |
|(1941).                                                              |

|He became a popular writer of childrens literature, authoring       |
|now-classic works such as  Krokodil [Crocodile] (1916);          |
|Tarakanishche [The Monster Cockroac] (1923), and Aibolit       |
|[Ouch-it-hurts] (1929). He also authored a book on childrens      |
|speech, Ot dvukh do piati [From Two to Five] (1933), which was       |
|republished several times throughout his life, as well as Zhivoi kak|
|zhizn [Alive as Life] (1962), about the Russian language. In 1962 he|
|was awarded an honorary degree at Oxford. Before and after the       |
|Revolution, Chukovsky experienced periodic attacks by the government |
|for his writings. Nevertheless, Chukovsky defended the writers       |
|Mikhail Zoshchenko, Anna Akhmatovoa, and Alexander Solzhenitsyn while|
|they were attacked by the regime. Toward the end of his life, he     |
|publicly defended the poet Joseph Brodsky. His daughter, Lydia       |
|Chukovsky, also a writer, was a close friend of Akhmatova. His oldest|
|son, Nikolai, was a translator.                                      |
