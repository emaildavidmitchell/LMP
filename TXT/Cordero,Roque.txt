      Cordero, Roque Jacinto (19172008).


      Marie Labonville


      Roque Cordero was a Panamanian composer, conductor, and educator, and
the only twentieth-century Panamanian composer to gain international
recognition. During the 1940s he studied composition and conducting in the
United States, returning in 1950 to Panama. In 1966, difficult professional
circumstances motivated his return to the United States where he completed
his career and died at the age of ninety-one. His lifelong devotion to
Panamanian culture is reflected in the music he composed. Most of his works
are based on the twelve-tone technique, which he frequently modified for
artistic reasons or to impart subtle Panamanian musical flavor. His
prizewinning Symphony No. 2 (1956) provoked controversy at its Caracas
premiere because its advanced musical language offended those who believed
that Latin American composers should avoid European avant-garde techniques
and conform to a more obviously nationalist style. Corderos mature output
includes pieces for piano, orchestra, string orchestra, soloist with
orchestra, chamber ensemble, chorus, ballet, and film, as well as three
pedagogical works and at least sixty articles and lectures. His creativity
brought him numerous national and international commissions and honors.
Although his output has not been studied in a comprehensive fashion,
selected compositions have been analyzed in postgraduate theses and
dissertations.
      Corderos interest in music emerged his early teens, when he joined
his school orchestra on violin and school band on clarinet. He also joined
the municipal Firemens Band as clarinetist and copyist. By his mid-teens
he had begun composing pieces for band in a popular style. Though largely
self-taught in solfge, harmony, and instrumentation, he sought additional
instruction from Herbert de Castro and Pedro Rebolledo. After the success
of his band works he became interested in orchestral music and in 1938
helped found the orchestra of the Musical Union, which later developed into
the national symphony orchestra. In 1939 he completed his first orchestral
work, Capricho interiorano. He then began studying the melodic and rhythmic
elements of Panamanian folk dances in order to give his future works a
national flavor without resorting to direct musical quotes.
      In 1943 a scholarship enabled Cordero to travel to the United States
to study music education at the University of Minnesota. That same year he
received funding from conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos to study counterpoint
with Austrian twelve-tone composer Ernst Krenek at nearby Hamline
University. Although Krenek believed that the European twelve-tone
technique was not congruent with Corderos desire to be a Panamanian
composer, Cordero convinced him to teach him the method so he could use it
in the service of his own aesthetic. In 1946, with the completion of
Corderos Sonatina for Violin and Piano, he and Krenek agreed that he had
achieved his ideal of combining the twelve-tone system with Panamanian
musical elements.
      From that point forward Cordero employed the twelve-tone method for
most of his compositions, though he frequently modified the technique. To
suggest the flavor of Panamanian folk music, he crafted his twelve-note
rows so they would create melodies or harmonies that had tonal
characteristics without being explicitly tonal. Sometimes he violated the
rules of the system by repeating pitches or altering their order. He
energized his musical textures with persistently repeated short rhythmic
figures, meters that changed frequently, and rhythms of Panamanian folk
dances such as the mejorana, the punto, the cumbia, the pasillo, and
especially the tamborito.
      By the time Cordero returned to Panama in 1950 he had graduated from
Hamline University, married Elizabeth Johnson, won a Guggenheim fellowship,
interacted with notable Latin American and North American composers, and
studied conducting with Leon Barzin, Stanley Chapple, and Dimitri
Mitropoulos. In Panama City he obtained a teaching post at the national
conservatory, where he became assistant director in 1951. When the
conservatory was restructured in 1953 and renamed National Institute of
Music, he was appointed director.  In that capacity he introduced a number
of reforms in the curriculum, student body, and staff.
      In 1957 Corderos Symphony No. 2 won the Caro de Boesi prize at the
Second Festival of Latin American Music in Caracas. [INSERT IMAGE OF THE
FIRST PAGE OF THE SYMPHONY NEAR HERE]  [INSERT SOUND FILE OF THE SYMPHONY
NEAR HERE]  Arriving at the festival for the premiere he was faced with a
controversy about the modernist idiom of his symphony. Some believed that
his twelve-tone musical language was unsuited for Latin American
compositions, which should conform to a more obviously nationalist style.
Cordero explained, as he would many times in the future, that nationalism
is an aesthetic but the twelve-tone system is a technique, and a composer
may use any technique in the service of an aesthetic (see for example his
Dodecafonismo versus nacionalismo? written in 1957 for the Caracas music
magazine Clave).
      After his international exposure in Caracas, Cordero began receiving
commissions from abroad including one from the Koussevitzky Music
Foundation for his award-winning violin concerto (1962). He began traveling
periodically in the United States and Latin America to give lectures, guest
conduct, judge composition contests, and participate in the Inter-American
Music Festivals in Washington and meetings of the Inter-American Music
Council.
      In 1964 Cordero resigned as director of the National Institute of
Music to become conductor of the national orchestra. His plans to
professionalize the ensemble, however, were not supported. This
disappointment, combined with the frustrations he had experienced while
director of the music institute, led him in 1966 to return to the United
States as professor of composition and assistant director of the Latin
American Music Center at Indiana University.
      Cordero left Indiana University in 1969 and moved to New York to serve
as a music editor for Peer Southern publishing company. In 1972 he
relocated to Normal, Illinois to become the first professor of composition
at Illinois State University. There his creativity was stimulated by the
excellent performers on the teaching staff, for whom he composed many solo
and chamber works. During his twenty-eight years at Illinois State
University he established a series of campus concerts of Latin American
music, fulfilled commissions, presented his music at festivals, and
accepted invitations to lecture and guest conduct. He also composed his
most ambitious work, Cantata para la paz (1979). His accomplishments were
rewarded with grants, commissions, and honors including the Koussevitzky
International Recording Award (1974) for his violin concerto. [INSERT

      Although he retired in 1987 from full-time teaching, Cordero continued
to teach part-time at Illinois State University until 2000. He then moved
to Dayton, Ohio to be near family. In 2008, following a short illness, he
passed away at the age of ninety-one. His remains were repatriated and
buried in Panama City on his ninety-fifth birthday, August 16, 2012.
