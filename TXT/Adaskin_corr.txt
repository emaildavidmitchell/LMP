Adaskin, Murray (1906-2002)

Jeremy Strachan



Born at Toronto, Ontario, Murray Adaskin was a violinist, composer, and academic whose music was widely performed in Canada. Adaskin was violinist with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra from 1926-36, and held senior academic and administrative positions at the University of Saskatchewan (1952-73) and the Canada Council for the Arts (1966-69). His compositional style largely avoids allegiance to modern and experimental currents of the twentieth century, and balances conservatism and lyricality with atonal and folk elements. An expedition to Canada’s arctic to record Inuit singing in 1965 proved influential to Adaskin, and resulted in several works, including QALALA and NILAULA of the NORTH, (1969 for small orchestra), RANKIN INLET (1978 for piano duo), and ESKIMO MELODIES (1980 for piano). Adaskin wrote that he hoped his music would “someday be recognized for its Canadian flavour” and much of his programmatic oeuvre dedicates itself to regional and national topics. His chamber opera based on the Metis fur trader GRANT, WARDEN of the PLAINS was commissioned for Canada’s centenary of 1967. Along with brothers John (1908-1964) and Harry (1901-1994), the Adaskins were significant influences on the cultivation of art music in Canada during the post-war period.   Adaskin died at Victoria, British Columbia in 2002.
