Summary
Sisters Nellie and Gloria Campobello migrated from Northern Mexico to
Mexico City in 1923 where they became influential figures in the
development of Mexican dance and the professionalization of dancers. During
the 1930s, as dancers, choreographers, teachers, and dance administrators,
the Campobello sisters joined the governments efforts to develop a Mexican
dance form that could reflect the countrys modern aspirations and
revolutionary ideals, a nationalist project that started with the armed
uprising of 1910.  During this revolutionary period, their work reflected
the mestizo modernism that Mexican muralists and musicians had been
articulating since the early 1920s by combining elements from European
modernist aesthetics and Mexicos indigenous cultures. The Campobellos
participated in government-sponsored cultural missions that consisted of
brigades of artists and teachers who, as part of Mexicos post-
revolutionary project, travelled to rural areas in order to educate
indigenous populations, in subjects ranging from literacy to agricultural
techniques. These nationalist efforts prompted artists and teachers like
Nellie and Gloria to document traditional and indigenous costumes, crafts,
musical rhythms and dances as symbols of an emerging national identity. The
Campobello sisters and others used these materials in combination with
ballet and other movement techniques in order to compose choreographic
works representative of the nation. Gloria Campobello eventually became
Mexicos prima ballerina and the two sisters founded the Ballet of Mexico
City in 1941. In addition to her work in dance, Nellie Campobello wrote
several books and was the only female writer who published narrations of
the Mexican revolution based on her own experience as a child.

Training
Gloria Campobello was born Gloria Campbell Luna to Jess Campbell Morton
and Rafaela Luna. Her stepsister, Nellie Campobello, born to Felipe de
Jess Moya and Rafaela Luna, was named Francisca Ernestina Moya Luna at
birth. When Gloria and Nellie arrived in Mexico City in 1923, they became
known as the Campbell sisters as they associated themselves with the
British settled in the city.

As in many other countries during the 1920s, innovations by the Ballets
Russes served as the model of the modern in Mexico. Thus during this time,
ballet was considered the most fundamental and artistically sophisticated
dance training in Mexico City. Training was imparted in private lessons by
foreign teachers who had usually arrived in the country as dancers with
visiting companies from Italy, Russia, Poland, and the United States.
Gloria Campobello began her training with the Italian sisters, Amelia,
Adela, and Linda Acosta. Her sister Nellie then joined her and the two
continued training together with Carmen Gal, Stanislava Mol Potapovitch,
Carol Adamchevsky, and Eleonor Wallace. The Campobello sisters joined
Lettie Carrolls private dance school and debuted in her company in 1927.
With Carroll, a dance teacher from the United States who mostly worked with
the daughters of the Mexican elites and members of enclaves of foreigners
living in the city, they continued training in ballet and began to train in
jazz, tap, and other dance forms. Nellie and Gloria then conducted
intensive research in Mexican traditional and indigenous dances, which they
learned and taught throughout their careers. In some of her early works,
Nellie Campobello experimented with movement and sought to create her own
dance vocabulary because she did not want to imitate other performers.
Perhaps as a gesture of patriotic revelry, Nellie and Gloria eventually
relinquished Campbell as their adopted and given last names respectively
and became the Campobello sisters, as they aligned their dance work with
the governments post-revolutionary nationalist project.

Major Contributions to the Field and to Modernism
Through their research, choreographic experiments, and teaching work,
Nellie and Gloria Campobello promoted a combination of different dance
techniques as part of institutional efforts in the professionalization of
Mexican dancers. After leaving Carrolls company in 1929, they formed a
duet with Nellie playing masculine roles in regional Mexican dances
traditionally performed by a man and a woman. Their interest in Mexican
traditional and indigenous dances and rhythms as well as their fieldwork
through the cultural missions positioned them during the 1930s as experts
in these forms of expressive culture. In 1930, they became dance teachers
in the Seccin de Msica y Bailes Nacionales del Departamento de Bellas
Artes directed by the Secretaria de Educacion Publica (National Dances and
Music Section of the Department of Fine Arts directed by the Secretariat of
Public Education). Nellie Campobello also taught at the Escuela del
Estudiante Indgena (School of the Indigenous Student) and Gloria also
offered instruction at the Escuela Corregidora de Quertaro (The Mayoress
of Quertaro School). The Campobello sisters joined the teaching faculty at
the Escuela de Plstica Dinmica (School of Dynamic Plastic Art), the first
institutional effort in the professionalization of Mexican dancers. After
this school was disbanded, Nellie was appointed assistant to the director,
Carlos Merida, of the newly instituted Escuela de Danza (School of Dance)
in 1932, where she was joined by Gloria. In 1937, Nellie Campobello was
designated director of the School of Dance, which eventually became Escuela
Nacional de Danza (National School of Dance) and later Escuela Nacional de
Danza Nellie y Gloria Campobello (The Nellie and Gloria Campobello National
School of Dance). Nellies directorship spanned almost fifty years from1937
to 1983. Gloria continued choreographing and teaching Mexican traditional
dances and rhythms as well as ballet.

During the 1930s, the Campobellos contributed to the articulation of
Mexican modernism, characterized by the combination of European aesthetic
elements with a fervent nationalism fuelled by the countrys revolutionary
ideals. This nationalist mestizo modernism was constituted by cultural
productions that could be distinctively Mexican while having universal
appeal. Although the Campobello sisters relied on ballet technique as
foundational for dance training, as it was customary in Mexico at the time,
they also experimented with movement in their mass dances, which were
choreographic works for hundreds of performers. In collaboration with
visual artists and musicians, Nellie and Gloria premiered one such mass
dance, Ballet Simbolico 30-30 (Symbolic Ballet 30-30), in an open stadium
in November 20, 1931, as part of the programme to commemorate the twentieth
anniversary of the Mexican Revolution. In 1935, the mass dance was
performed again for thousands of people, including President Lzaro
Crdenas, at the National Stadium to celebrate the Day of the Soldier. This
mass dance included 400 women dressed in red, 200 female sowers, 200
peasants, 200 soldiers and 200 laborers performing alongside a multitude of
musicians, police officers, and teachers and students from elementary,
secondary and trade schools. The dance choreographed three phases
emblematic of revolutionary movements: a phase of armed struggle, a period
of unification through labour and increased peace, and ending with the
final stage of liberation from oppression. As a modernized dance in Mexico
during the 1930s, Ballet Simbolico 30-30 effectively represented the
unification of the Mexican working classes while claiming affinity and
solidarity with an international movement for global socialist revolution.

This mass dance marked Nellie and Gloria Campobellos commitment to join
institutionalized efforts that put art in the service of the people as part
of the Mexican governments revolutionary agenda and its accompanying
social policies. During this period, Nellie also authored several books
with themes pertaining to the Mexican Revolution, a topic that no other
woman in her time addressed. Her writing from this time includes a
compilation of poems, Yo ( I ) (1929); Cartucho (Cartridge, 1931); Las
Manos de Mam (My Moms Hands), illustrated by Jos Clemente Orozco (1937);
Apuntes Sobre la Vida Militar de Francisco Villa (Notes about the Military
Life of Francisco Villa, 1940); Tres Poemas (Three Poems, 1957); and Mis
Libros (My Books, 1960).

In 1940, Nellie and Gloria Campobello co-authored, Ritmos Indgenas de
Mxico (Indigenous Rhythms of Mexico), a book that compiled part of their
field research findings on Mexican traditional and indigenous dances and
rhythms.

Legacy
Gloria and Nellie Campobello were influential in legitimizing dance as a
profession and serious art in Mexico. They helped establish a practice of
combining Mexican traditional and indigenous dances and rhythms with other
dance forms for mass dances and for the concert stage. As teachers, they
trained the first generations of Mexican dancers who adopted modern
techniques exported from the U.S. in the early 1940s thereby redirecting
the course of concert dance in the country. During the 1930s, their work
was instrumental in developing Mexicos unique artistic modernism, which
set the bases for the cultural development of modern Mexico.

The Campobello sisters legacy remains palpable not only in the book they
co-authored, and the ones Nellie published, but also in the Nellie and
Gloria Campobello National School of Dance which still offers
specializations in contemporary dance as well as on Mexican folkloric and
Spanish dances.
