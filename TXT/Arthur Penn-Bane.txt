Arthur Penn

Charles Bane (University of Central Arkansas)

Arthur Penn (1922-2010) was an American stage director, television
producer, and filmmaker. While serving in the army, Penn became interested
in theater and directed plays for his fellow soldiers. During the 1950s,
Penns successful run as a director of television dramas for a variety of
series led to an offer to direct the feature film The Left Handed Gun
(1958) starring Paul Newman. Throughout the 1960s, Penn alternated film and
stage work, directing some of Hollywoods biggest stars. During this
period, Penn received three Academy Award nominations for The Miracle
Worker (1962), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and Alices Restaurant (1969). The
Miracle Worker was a film version of Penns Tony Award-winning Broadway
production. Following this success, Penn became heavily influenced by the
French New Wave and combined that influence with cultural commentary by
creating films that captured the decades unrest and pushed the boundaries
of cinematic sex and violence. Though controversial, Bonnie and Clyde and
Alices Restaurant were both critical and box office successes. Penns next
major film was the 1970 comedy western Little Big Man, starring Dustin
Hoffman. Though he did not sustain the level of critical and commercial
acclaim attained by these films, Penn spent the next three decades
alternating between narrative films and documentary segments. In the early
2000s, he returned to his theater and television roots by directing
successful stage productions of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (2000) and
Fortunes Fool (2002) and by serving as Executive Producer for the
television series Law & Order (2000-2001).
