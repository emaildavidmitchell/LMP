THE 400 BLOWS (1959)

The 400 Blows (Les 400  Coups),  a  black  and  white  French  feature  film
directed by Franois Truffaut, is one of the most influential works  of  the
French New Wave. Strongly autobiographical, it tells the  story  of  Antoine
Doinel, a troubled Parisian boy struggling with an indifferent  family  life
and stultifying school discipline, who is placed in a  reform  school  after
he commits a series of petty crimes. Truffaut chose  the  actor  Jean-Pierre
Laud to play Doinels  character  in  not  just  400  Blows,  but  in  four
subsequent films.  Influenced by Jean Vigos 1933 short  Zero  for  Conduct,
the film is notable for its simple, poetic  realism  and  its  unsentimental
look at childhood,  which  is  a  radical  departure  from  the  edulcorated
symbolism of films like Albert Lamorisses  1953  White  Mane.  Its  use  of
innovative camera techniques, such as long tracking shots,  jump  cuts,  and
dissolves reflects Truffauts preoccupation with  auteurism,  in  particular
with Alexandre Astrucs notion of the camera  pen  (camera-stylo)  as  the
main  expressive  tool  in  the  directors  arsenal.  The   films   social
commentary,  though  oblique,  is  unmistakable:  Truffaut   critiques   the
conformism, rigidity and traditionalism of  not  only  French  society,  but
also of French cinema. The 400 Blows is  rebellious  but  hardly  optimistic
and its iconic final image, of a freeze-frame  of  Doinel  looking  directly
into the camera places some of the responsibility of his   struggle  on  the
viewers.
