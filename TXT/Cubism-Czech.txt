Czech Cubism

Cubism was one of the first currents of the European avant-garde, which
asserted itself meaningfully in Czech art and developed concisely here in
the areas of everyday objects, interiors and in architecture. The use of
its characteristic polygonal morphology led to Czech Cubism being evaluated
as a style, although the goals of the creators of new art (the term
Cubism was introduced ex post) were to find a new path, the horizon of
which  hitherto demarcated with a series of -isms (hence also the
pejorative designation of Cubism)  had to be transcended in order for art
to reflect its mission in the modern era. In the autumn of 1911, the
progressive wing of artists, influenced by works of Picasso, Derain and
Czanne established the Group of Fine Artists, the main protagonist of
which became painter Emil Filla (1882-1953). The Groups core included
painters Antonn Prochzka (1882-1945), Josef apek (1887-1945), sculptor
Otto Gutfreund (1889-1927), architects and designers Pavel Jank (1882-
1956), Josef Gor (1880-1945), Vlastislav Hofman (1884-1963), Josef
Chochol (1880-1956) and theoretician Vclav Vilm tech (1885-1974). The
same year, the first issue of the groups periodical, Umleck msnk,
was published and became a platform for formulating the principles of new
art.

Emil Filla achieved autonomy of creative form most expressively in
painting. He expanded his figural motifs of 1911-13 to still lifes, in
which an orientation toward Picassos work is most evident. In addition to
Cubism, the work of Prochzka shows influences of Fauvism and
Expressionism, and there appears a mobile motif as well. apek, who was
developing his artistic and literary talents simultaneously, entered the
Cubist current of painting with a distinctive and independent conception.
Kubita, whose artistic development had been accelerated by his stays in
Paris in 1909-10, used expressive psychologisation of the motif and plot
content. Kubita and Filla also worked peripherally in sculpture, but it
was Gutfreund who unequivocally excelled in this field and also made
theoretical contributions to it. In field of architecture, the most
productive was Jank, who also ranked among Cubisms most active
theoreticians. Janks architectural designs are much more telling than his
realisations of his inventiveness. Gor designed Pragues first major
Cubist building, the House of the Black Madonna (1911-12); his
stylistically purest work is the sanatorium house in Bohdane. One of the
groups most original architects was Hofman, who took up ambitious
modifications to cemetery structures in Pragues blice district (1912).
Chochol, who dynamised otherwise modest faades with polygonal forms,
enhanced Prague architecture with a trio of Cubist buildings (a row house,
a villa and an apartment building). Cubist architects also pursued interior
and furniture design and established the manufacturing company Prask
umleck dlny (1912). Jank and Hofman also designed a series of ceramic
tableware which was produced and sold by the art production cooperative
Artl. Czech Cubists presented their work abroad at the collective
exhibition at the Goltz Salon in Munich (1913) and at the Deutscher
Werkbund in Cologne (1914).
