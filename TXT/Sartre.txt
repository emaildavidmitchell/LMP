Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) was a French novelist, playwright, literary
critic and existentialist philosopher. He was born in Paris, France. He was
one of the leading French public intellectuals of the twentieth century,
most notable for advancing existentialist philosophy and thus shaping the
intellectual field in the decade following the Second World War. Sartre was
awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1964, but he refused it.

After graduating from the cole Normale Suprieure in 1929, where he met
his lifelong partner and fellow philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre
served in the French army from 1929 to 1931. He later taught in the lyces
of Le Havre, Lao and Paris until 1945. During his years as a professor,
Sartres first novel, La Nause (1938; The Diary of Antoine Roquentin, tr.
1949 / Nausea, tr. 1965) was published. This epistolary novel, which is
considered a canonical work of EXISTENTIALISM, explores the relationship of
contingency and necessity in Roquentins ability to define himself and his
freedom. The collection of stories Le Mur (The Wall, and Other Stories, tr.
1948), published in the same year, also brought him immediate recognition
as another expression of his early themes of alienation, freedom and
artistic salvation.

Sartres early novels reflect his close study of the German philosopher
Edmund Husserls phenomenological method (which proposes an unprejudiced
study of events); Sartre developed his own phenomenological account of
imagination, in such works as: LImagination (1936; Imagination: A
Psychological Critique, tr. 1962), Esquisse dune thorie des emotions
(1939; The Emotions: Outline of a Theory, tr. 1948), and LImaginaire:
Psychologie phnomnologique de limagination (1940; The Psychology of
Imagination, tr. 1948).

In 1943, Sartres major philosophical treatise, Ltre et le Nant (Being
and Nothingness, tr. 1956) was published. This work provides the most
detailed account of his existentialist thought, drawing an opposition
between human consciousness or no-thingness (nant), and being or thingness
(tre). Sartre describes consciousness as always self-conscious, as opposed
to matter; hence it escapes determinism, and thus is essentially for
itself (pour soi) the source of freedom. Freedom of choice is not
idealized, according to Sartre, but rather, it is conceived within ones
contingent, historical circumstances. With freedom comes the social
responsibility of giving meaning to an otherwise groundless existence.

Sartres existentialist ethics can be glimpsed in his novels and plays, in
particular in the four-volume novel Les Chemins de la libert (The Roads to
Freedom), of which Sartre only wrote three volumes: Lge de raison (1945;
The Age of Reason, tr. 1947), Le Sursis (1945; The Reprieve, tr. 1947) and,
La Mort dans lme (1949; Iron in the Soul, tr. 1950 / Troubled Sleep, tr.
1953). The trilogy portrays the wartime struggles of Parisian intellectuals
with the notion of freedom; it presents a more grounded view of
EXISTENTIALISM, tracing the progression of the effects of the Second World
War on Sartres thought toward engagement in both life and literature.
The shift in his philosophical position toward conceiving of freedom as a
social responsibility culminated in Sartres immensely popular public
lecture LExistentialisme est un humanisme (1946; Existentialism and
Humanism, 1948), which he presented in Paris on October 28, 1945.

During the same decade, Sartre wrote several successful plays, including
Les Mouches (1943; The Flies, tr. 1946), which allegorizes the German
occupation through the myth of Orestes, a young killers commitment to
freedom in the face of an oppressed Jupiter. Huis Clos (1945; In Camera,
tr. 1946 / No Exit, tr. 1947) explores issues of self-consciousness and
tormented relationships, where three deceased characters are doomed to
remain together in a room for eternity. Les Mains Sales (1948; Crime
Passionnel, tr. 1949 / Dirty Hands, tr. 1949), set in a fictional Communist
country in Eastern Europe during the Second World War, depicts a killers
philosophical or political motivations behind a killing. Other plays of the
same period include Le Diable et le bon Dieu (1951; Lucifer and the Lord,
tr. 1952) and Les Squestrs dAltona (1959; Loser Wins, tr. 1960 / The
Condemned of Altona, tr. 1961).

Sartre devoted a considerable part of his career to literary criticism. He
co-founded the monthly journal Les Temps Modernes along with de Beauvoir.
The many articles they wrote and edited were later published as a series
entitled Situations, between 1947 and 1976. In his famous series of essays,
Quest-ce que la littrature? (1948; What is Literature?, tr. 1949), Sartre
expounds on his ethical shift toward the social responsibility of the
intellectual, and a committed literature, which prose can achieve, whereas
poetry cannot. This marks his rejection of the literary practice of Lart
pour lart (art for arts sake). Other publications of literary criticism
in this period include his book Baudelaire (1947; tr. 1949) and Saint
Genet, comdien et martyr (1952; Saint Genet, Actor and Martyr, tr. 1963).

In the post-war years, Sartre became increasingly involved with politics,
particularly Marxism. His publication of the philosophical work, Critique
de la raison dialectique (1960; Critique of Dialectical Reason, tr. 1976)
reflects his engagement with social and political issues in Marxism,
questions of choice, historical contingency and its material restrictions
on freedom.

Sartres last major works include his autobiography, Les Mots (1963; The
Words, tr. 1964) and LIdiot de famille (1971-72; The Family Idiot, tr.
1981-1993), a biographical study of Gustave Flaubert.
