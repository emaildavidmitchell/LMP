González Tuñón, Enrique (1901–1943)

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

Enrique González Tuñón was an Argentine journalist, poet and novelist. Together with his younger brother, Raúl, he was one of the main exponents of the country’s literary bohemia and avant-garde of the 1920s. Usually included in the ‘group of Florida’ (writers oriented towards a renewal of literature), he was ideologically close also to the ‘group of Boedo’, which favored the social and political commitment of writers. 



Tuñón collaborated with the foremost newspapers and literary journals of the time (Inicial, Caras y Caretas, Martín Fierro, Proa), and from 1925 to 1931 with the newspaper Crítica, where he was put in charge of a weekly column on tango, later known as ‘glosa’, which included the reproduction of the lyrics of a tango, accompanied by his exegesis and commentary. He also collaborated with Noticias Gráficas and, starting from 1935, with El Mundo, both newspapers in which he continued publishing ‘glosas’ of news, a peculiar journalistic style, shared by Roberto Arlt, another outstanding figure in Argentine literature. These glosas were created from an expansion and re-elaboration of the press cablegram, generating a genre between journalism and literature, narrative and essay, poetic language and colloquial language, and incorporating the use of lunfardo, the lingo of the popular classes.

The topics of his glosas and his literary work – always presented from a clear position of social and political commitment with the left – define him as a reporter of big international events (WWII, the Spanish civil war, the workers’ strikes and battles) and of daily life in the popular streets and districts of Buenos Aires in the ‘20s and ‘30s, as well as of events and people of a society that was deeply affected by the economic crisis and rapid process of modernization. His writings on popular culture in the lower segments of society, in particular on the music, lyrics and language of tango, contributed to this genre’s diffusion to a wider public and to its recognition as a genuine musical expression of Argentine culture. 



Tuñón’s first publication was entitled Tangos (1926) and collected a good part of his work on tango lyrics for Crítica. His other writings, El alma de las cosas inanimadas (1927), La rueda del molino mal pintado (1928), and his main work Camas desde un peso (1932) focus on life in the lower strata of society and on the negative effects of the economic crisis and process of modernization. Tuñón also wrote political satire (El Tirano, 1932) and poetry, and was the author of film scripts (Mañana me suicido, 1942; Pasión imposible, 1943) and plays. Finally, he composed several tangos, among which were Pa’l cambalache, written with Rafael Rossi and recorded in 1929 by Carlos Gardel, and Tengo apuro (1927).
