ANDRÉ PRÉVOST (1934-2001)

	Paul Bazin

	The career of André Prévost was punctuated by many prizes and commissions. Profoundly expressive, his music has been performed in America, in Asia and in Europe. Prévost’s catalogue contains many pieces for orchestra and strings: Cantate pour cordes (commissioned by Yehudi Menuhin, 1987) is a good example besides the concertante-style Pyknon (for violin and orchestra, 1966) and the vigorous and lyrical Sonata for violin and piano (1961). His colossal Terre des hommes (1967), for triple choir, large orchestra and two narrators, composed for the opening ceremonies of Expo ‘67 in Montreal, launched his career.
