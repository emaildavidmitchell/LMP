Isokon (1931-39)
Michael Johnson, Northumbria University
Isokon was a British furniture and architectural design company founded in
London in 1931. Led by architect Wells Coates and plywood manufacturer Jack
Pritchard, Isokon was among the first systematic attempts to introduce
modernist design to Britain. The founders of Isokon were committed to the
principles of European modernism and aimed to create standardised housing
and furniture based on modern materials and production processes. In
interwar Britain, these designs represented radical new solutions for
modern living.
Jack Pritchard joined the Venesta Plywood Company in 1925. At this time
plywood was regarded as a cheap substitute for solid wood, but Pritchard
was intrigued by its intrinsic properties of lightness, fluidity and
strength, and was keen to promote it as a material for modern design. In
1929 he encountered the work of Canadian-born designer Wells Coates, who
had recently created innovative plywood factory interiors and shop-fittings
for Cresta, a silk manufacturer. Pritchard and Coates founded the firm of
Wells Coates and Partners in 1930 to facilitate collaboration. Tensions
between the two prompted reorganisation, however, and the firm of Isokon
Limited was founded on 31 December 1931. The name was derived from the term
Isometric Unit Construction, owing to Coatess preference for isometric
drawing.
A company memo of March 1932 listed Isokons aims thus: to use
standardisation, new materials, moveable partition walls, ribbon windows
and integrated furniture. Houses were to be built on the principle of
standardised units, allowing interior equipment to be fitted into any
shell that the Company may build (Isokon, company memo of March 1932). The
directors of the company were Pritchards wife Molly, a bacteriologist, the
solicitor Frederick Graham-Maw, and the economist Robert S. Spicer. In
practice, however, the company was run by Pritchard, who hired designers to
create the product range and oversaw the marketing.
Isokons core principles were realised in its first major project, the
design and construction of Lawn Road Flats in Hampstead (1933-34). The
Pritchards commissioned Coates to design a block of flats based on Le
Corbusiers concept of the minimum dwelling. Coates designed a pristine
white edifice with graceful cantilevered access decks. Aimed at young
professionals, the block contained 22 single flats, four double flats and
three studio flats, plus staff quarters, kitchens and a garage.
The interiors reflected Coatess ideal of a rigorous, frugal lifestyle
unencumbered by possessions, which was in part derived from the concept of
Existenz-minimum (minimal living) developed at the Congrs internationaux
d'architecture moderne(CIAM) in 1929. Built-in furniture included a
sliding table, armchair, radio and divan. The aesthetic was minimalist
throughout, and made much use of plywood. A beacon of modernist ideals, the
building became a haven for designers fleeing oppression in Nazi Germany.
Walter Gropius, the former principal of the Bauhaus, arrived in London in
Autumn 1934 and took up residence at Lawn Road Flats, followed by Marcel
Breuer.

Isokon commissioned designs from leading exponents of modernism, initially
to provide furniture for Lawn Road Flats, but with the long-term aim of
transforming the standard of design within the British home. Coates
designed a book unit in 1933, as well as a desk made from the same units.
Gropius was appointed Controller of Design for Isokon in October 1935. When
he departed for the USA March 1937, he recommended the former Bauhaus
student Marcel Breuer as his replacement.
Breuer was eager to continue his experiments with tubular steel furniture,
but Pritchard advised him that the British were too conservative to buy
metal furniture. Instead, Breuer worked in Pritchards favoured material,
plywood, creating five notable pieces in which the material was used in a
highly fluid manner. These included a nest of tables, in which each table
is formed from a single sheet of plywood, and a Long Chair, which has an
undulating seat and wave-like arm rests. These pieces perhaps reveal the
influence of Alvar Aalto, who developed a more organic approach to
modernism using moulded wood, but they were also influential in their own
right. In 1937 Breuer designed a restaurant and bar (the Isobar) as an
addition to the communal facilities at Lawn Road Flats, which became a
centre of intellectual life in London.

A notable Isokon product was a bookstand designed by Austrian migr Egon
Riss, which resembled saddlebags slung over a donkeys back. Known as the
Penguin Donkey, this was marketed via sales leaflets inserted into the
inexpensive paperback books published by Penguin, which helped to
democratise knowledge in the interwar period and beyond. Isokons striking
publicity material was designed by another Bauhaus migr, Lszl Moholy-
Nagy, who arrived in Britain in May 1935. His sales leaflets featured
innovative graphic designs, while his Isokon logo depicted a folded plywood
chair.

Isokon was not a commercial success and its influence on the British
domestic landscape was limited due to a lack of financial support and the
difficulty of converting British consumers to modernist aesthetics. With
the outbreak of World War II, Isokons supply of cheap plywood from Estonia
was terminated and the firm ceased production in 1939. However, Pritchard
revived the Isokon Furniture Company in 1963 and hired Ernest Race to
produce new designs. In 1968, Pritchard licensed John Alan Designs to
reproduce notable Isokon pieces, including Breuers Long Chair and Nesting
Tables.
