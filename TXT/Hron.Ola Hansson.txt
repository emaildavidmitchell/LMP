Hansson, Ola (1860-1925)

|Ola Hansson was among the most innovative and          |[pic]           |
|ground-breaking authors and critics of early Swedish   |                |
|modernism. With his delicate prose sketches Sensitiva  |                |
|amorosa he established himself as the central figure of|                |
|Swedish Decadence. He played a crucial role in         |                |
|introducing both Nietzsche and Strindberg to the German|                |
|public. In 1889 he married the authoress Laura Marholm |                |
|(ne Mohr) (1854-1928), and in the same year they left |                |
|Sweden. The couple moved several times between Germany,|                |
|France, Switzerland, and Turkey. Both of them suffered |                |
|from incipient mental disorder. In 1925, Ola Hansson   |                |
|died in Turkey and was buried in Sweden in 1926.       |                |
|Hansson is acknowledged as one of the major (albeit    |                |
|initially misjudged) innovators of modern Swedish      |                |
|literature. His earlier texts are highly valued for    |                |
|their subtle psychology as an answer to the            |                |
|programmatic literature of the Swedish 1890s, while his|                |
|later texts display a tendency towards the political   |                |
|ideas of Pan-Germanism.                                |                |

Born in Skne (Scania), Ola Hansson came from a family of peasant stock.  He
debuted in 1884, and the following year he  published  the  verse-collection
Notturno where he introduced some of  the  central  features  of  his  early
works, such as pessimism and angst  as  well  as  the  magnificence  of  the
Scania landscape. In 1887,  his  breakthrough  prose  collection,  Sensitiva
amorosa, caused a scandal among his contemporaries who were shocked  by  the
morbid  eroticism,  the  psycho-physiologic  determinism  and  the  Bourget-
inspired depiction of  decadent  dissolution.  The  outraged  Swedish  press
embarked on a moral campaign against the text and  thus  cemented  Hanssons
decision to turn his back on Sweden. He left his native country for  Germany
where he established a reputation as a critic and essayist. His writings  on
Poe and Nietzsche in particular helped draw public attention to two  authors
whose influence, in turn, can  be  seen  in  Hanssons  own  works.  In  his
collection of symbolic-surrealistic prose poems,  Ung  Ofegs  visor  (Young
Ofegs Ditties), he develops a concept of  personality  strongly  influenced
by Nietzsches notion of the subject. Parias, on the other hand, is  written
under the influence of Edgar Allan Poes texts and consists of a  series  of
criminal case studies, addressing the subtle mechanisms of determinism.
