Cerqueira, Fernando (1941)

Ilza Nogueira


Fernando Cerqueira was  one  of  the  most  representative  members  of  the
Composers Group of Bahia. He was born in Ilhus-BA, Brazil, on  September
8, 1941. A scholarship to study at the Bahia Central Seminar  led  him  to
move to Salvador in 1953. Graduating in Philosophy in 1962, he  entered  the
Music School of the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), where  he  graduated
in composition in 1969 under Ernst Widmers orientation.  In  1970,  he  was
hired by the Brasilia University Foundation, where he  taught  between  1970
and 1974. Returning to  Salvador  in  1975,  he  became  full  professor  of
composition  and  theoretic  disciplines  at  UFBA,  where  he  developed  a
successful  professional  career  between  1975  and  1995.  He   was   also
clarinetist of the University Symphony  Orchestra  and  wind  ensemble,  and
joined the Bahia Symphony Orchestra (2nd clarinet)  in  the  period  between
1982 and 1987. Since 2000, Fernando Cerqueira has  devoted  himself  to  art
education, coordinating the Music program of the  Centro  Projeto  Ax  in
Salvador, BA. Cerqueiras musical catalogue consists of 40 works  classified
with opus numbers and  43  non-classified  works,  including  sacred  music,
studies, arrangements, incidental music for dance and theater, sound  tracks
and sketches for collective improvisation with didactic purpose.


Work

Fernando Cerqueiras works  can  be  considered  a  musical  reflex  of  his
career: while singing in  the  UFBA  madrigal  choir,  he  composed  several
arrangements  of  Brazilian  folk  and  popular  music  (Samba  de  Roda  na
Capoeira, Duas Cantigas de Roda, Imbalana, Na  Bahia  Tem,  Carolina,  Roda
Viva); integrating the Composers  Group  of  Bahia,  he  produced  avant-
gardist  original  works,  many  of  which  were  prizewinners  in  national
festivals and competitions (Metamorfose I op. 2,  Transubstanciao  op.  3,
Heterofonia do tempo op. 4,  Contrao, op. 5, Decantao op.  6);  teaching
composition workshop at the Braslia University Foundation, he  elaborated
many sketches for collective  improvisation  with  didactic  purpose;  while
integrating the staff  of  UFBA  School  of  Music  and  Scenic  Arts,  he
composed  several  audiocomplements  for  Dance  and  Theater  (Msica  para
Percusso,  A Vertigem do Sagrado, lbum de Famlia, Diz que Sim -  Diz  que
No, Yerma, Bailes Pastoris da Bahia); while studying for his Master  Degree
in Theory of Literature  (1990-1994)  he  was  interested  in  the  intimate
relationship between poetry and musical conception, a product  of  which  is
Desnovelo op. 29; and, finally, as Music Coordinator of the  Ax  Project,
he has composed works for scenic spectacles using the musical forces of  the
project (pop band, percussion band, berimbau orchestra), examples  of  which
are his Trs Ambincias para a  Bandax  and  Composio  para  Quietude  na
Terra.

Cerqueiras musical production embrace works  for  solo  instrument  (flute,
oboe, clarinet / bass-clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, voice, piano and  guitar),
traditional and original chamber formations,  choir  (a  cappella  and  with
instrumental accompaniment), chamber and symphonic orchestra, and choir  and
orchestra  (with  or  without  solo   voices).   Among   these   categories,
quantitatively expressive is  his  music  for  a  cappella  choir  and  non-
traditional mixed ensembles.

Fernando Cerqueira was distinguished in many National competitions  and  won
international visibility through expositions, publications, and  recordings.
Contrao (1969, mixed ensemble) was exposed in the Tribune  Internationale
des Compositeurs (1970, Paris); Quanta (1972, for mixed ensemble)  was  the
only Latin-American composition selected in 1974 for  the  Jours  Musicaux
of the ISCM in  Holland  (Den  Haag);  Quanta  and  Sndrome  (1973,  string
quartet) were published in Germany by  TONOS  Verlag  (Darmstadt)  in  1974;
Sete Esboos para Espantar G. DArezzo (1989, percussion duo) was  published
in the United  States  by  Brazilian  Music  Enterprise  (WA)  in  1995  and
recorded in the same year by GHA (Brussels).

Cerqueiras work was theme of  a  Doctoral  thesis  of  the  Graduate  Music
Program  at  UFBA:  O  Pensamento  Composicional  de  Fernando   Cerqueira:
memrias e paradigmas by ngelo Tavares Castro was  defended  in  2004  and
published in 2007 by the Federal University of  Bahia  Press.  In  his  book
Artimanhas do Compor e do Pensar:  percurso  criativo  atravs  de  textos
(Salvador: Quarteto, Srie Fundao Gregrio de Mattos,  vol.  5,  2007),  a
collection of articles, essays, expositions and  testimonies,  the  composer
comments some of his works.

In  2011,  his  musical  work  was  catalogued  by  the   research   project
Historical Landmarks of Contemporary Composition at UFBA. This  catalogue,
with  78  musical  items,   includes   the   composers   life   chronology,
bibliography and discography. It is available for download  in  the  website
