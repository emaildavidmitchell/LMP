Acogny, Germaine (1944) 

Summary
In a career that has spanned over forty years, Germaine Acogny has
contributed to modernism in dance by merging culturally situated West
African dances from Senegal and Benin with Western dance forms such as
Graham technique and classical ballet to create a new African dance
aesthetic. Her work emerged from an African postcolonial framework, and her
pedagogy codified a modernist Africanist technique. In the 1960s when
African dance was viewed by some Western audiences as primitive and
timeless, Acogny advocated the necessity of viewing African dance as
evolving and changing. Senegals first President, Leopold Sedar Senghor,
and French choreographer Maurice Bjart appointed Acogny director of the
Senegal-based Mudra Afrique that trained African-based choreographers and
teachers. Acogny has taught and performed globally and is the founder of
cole de Sables (School of Sands), a training, residency, and research
centre in Senegal. She also founded the Jant-Bi (The Sun) Company in 1996.
She is known as Mama Acogny because she has mentored numerous young
dancers and choreographers in Africa and globally. She also has been called
one of the founders of contemporary African dance. Notable touring works
include Faagala (2003), which addressed the Rwandan genocide. It was a
choreographic collaboration between Jant Bi and Japans Kota Yamasaki in
2004.

Early Training and Career
Germaine Acogny, granddaughter of a Yoruba priestess, was born in Benin in
1944. She grew up in Senegal, attended convent school in Dakar, and studied
at the Simon Siegel School in Paris. Her early training was defined by the
dances she learned in Benin and Senegal and her study with dance modernists
in Paris. In 1965, with a diploma in harmonic gymnastics, she returned to
Senegal, where she met the American modern dance choreographer, Katherine
Dunham. In 1972 Acogny was appointed Head of the Dance Division at
Senegals first National Arts Institute. During this time she went to
Burkina Faso on an exchange with choreographers Irene Tassembedo and
Alassane Congo and to New York to study at the Alvin Ailey School.
President Senghor and Maurice Bjart appointed Acogny to head Mudra Afrique
in 1977. Dancers came from many African countries to learn ballet, modern,
and African dance idioms. She worked with Maurice Bjart when she was
director of Mudra Afrique in Dakar from 19771982 and with his company in
Brussels from 19821985. The aim of her school in Africa was to train
dancers to absorb the steps and values of other dance forms in order to
generate a new kind of African dance. The dancers who studied at Mudra
Afrique established new training programs as they returned to home
countries throughout West and Central Africa.

Major Contributions to the Field and to Modernism
Like many other modernists, Acogny often used hybridity as a creative
strategy. Acognys pedagogy and choreography, for instance, drew from a
combination of movement practices and the embodied experiences of living in
the culture where the dances were practiced. The result was an African
dance idiom that paid respect to the diversity of each regions dance
customs and created a codified technique that united and integrated them.
The technique incorporated traditional dances from West African and Western
dance forms with a concentration on spinal undulation and vibration and
constant communication between the musicians and dancers. Acognys
technique drew from images in nature and surrounding cultural environments
with titles of movement sequences such as the Baobab Tree, Arched Bow, and
The Passenger.

Her work also drew on her knowledge of other art forms and sometimes
contained implicit political content to create dances that carefully
layered movement with cultural commentary. For instance, Femme Noire, her
first choreography, premiered at Senegals National Theatre Daniel Sorano
in June 1972. The theme of this work was black womanhood, as expressed in
a similarly titled poem by Senegals first president and co-founder of
Negritude, Leopold Sedar Senghor, who was a modernist poet, politician, and
founder of the first Pan African Arts Festival.

While many European and North American modernists rejected tradition,
Acogny translated tradition. She did not want to limit African dance to
authentic, non-evolving black dance. Instead, she constructed an
ongoing inquiry into African dance, treating tradition as perpetually self-
renewing, and in turn she began to codify a pan-African aesthetic. She
addressed the importance of contextualizing the socio-cultural present with
traditional dance forms. So although her work was deeply rooted in popular
traditions, it was not a return to the past.

Legacy
In 1968 Acogny opened an African Dance School behind her home in Dakar. In
1998 she established cole de Sables in Toubab Dialaw Senegal, which
offered residency space, dance workshops for local and international
dancers, and a home base for the all male company Jant-Bi. Acogny and Jant
Bi have collaborated on numerous choreographic works with other artists,
such as Susane Linke, Kota Yamasaki, Jawole Zollar/Urban Bush Women, and
her son Patrick Acogny.
