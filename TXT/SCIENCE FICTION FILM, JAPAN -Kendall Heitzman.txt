SCIENCE FICTION FILM, JAPAN

The science-fiction films of postwar Japan have served as both an innocuous
escape from reality and a commentary on the concerns of contemporary
Japanese society: the threat of nuclear annihilation, environmental
degradation, and Japans place in the world.  The postwar rise of SF owes
a great deal to special-effects master Tsuburaya Eiji.  Tsuburaya began in
the film industry in 1919, and developed a number of techniques in film
processing, cinematography, costuming, and scale-models, all of which he
used for the 1954 blockbuster from Toho Studios, Gojira (Godzilla, 1954).
Along with a number of Godzilla sequels, Tsuburaya brought to life the
stars of many other kaij eiga, or monster films, including Rodan (in Sora
no daikaiju Radon [Rodan! The Flying Monster!, 1956]), Mothra (in Mosura
[Mothra, 1961]), and Ghidorah (in Sandaikaiju: Chikyu saidai no kessen
[Three Giant Monsters: The Greatest Battle on Earth, 1964]).  Daiei,
Nikkatsu, Shochiku, and Toei all produced their own kaij films, with
Daieis Gamera being perhaps the most famous character.  Many of
Tsuburayas Tohos monster films were produced with an eye toward release
in the American market, as were his sci-fi TV shows Urutora Q (Ultra Q,
1966), Urutoraman (Ultraman, 196667), and Urutora sebun (Ultra Seven,
196768).  These influenced subsequent generations of live-action shows,
including Kamen raidaa (Kamen Rider, 197173) and the Suupaa sentai series
(Power Rangers, 1975present).  The destruction of Japan, a traumatic
reiteration of the aftermath of World War II, continues to haunt the
Japanese science-fiction film; in Uchjin Tokyo ni arawaru (Warning from
Space, 1956), aliens warn of a planet on a collision course with Earth,
while in Nihon chinbotsu (Japan Sinks, 1973; remake 2006) Japan finds
itself dependent on the rest of the world when the homeland sinks into the
Japan Trench.  A parody, Nihon igai zenbu chinbotsu (Everything Other than
Japan Sinks, 2006), put Japan in the drivers seat.  In recent decades,
science-fiction has been a dominant genre in Japanese anime; key works
include the TV serials Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy, Tezuka Osamu, 196366)
and Mahha GoGoGo (Speed Racer, 196768), Uchu senkan Yamato (Space
Battleship Yamato, 1974), the Gandamu series franchise (Gundam,
1979present), Otomo Katsuhiros Akira (1988), Oshii Mamorus Kokaku
kidotai (Ghost in the Shell, 1995), the series Shin seiki Evangerion (Neon
Genesis Evangelion, 199697), and Otomos steampunk effort, Suchiimubooi
(Steamboy, 2004).
