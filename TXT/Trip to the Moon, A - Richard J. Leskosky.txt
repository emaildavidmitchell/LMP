Trip to the Moon, A (1902)

Le voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon) is the best-known work of magician and film and special effects pioneer Georges Méliès (1861-1938), the first science fiction film with a plot and multiple scenes of different special effects). It made Méliès famous worldwide, but piratical practices, particularly in the United States, denied him his due profits. Professor Barbenfouillis (Méliès) and a group of scientists fly to the moon in a capsule shot from a cannon and encounter its crustacean inhabitants (Selenites). After a running battle, the explorers return to Earth. The film’s first half owes much to Jules Verne’s novel De la terre à la lune (From the Earth to the Moon, 1865) while the second half derives from H. G. Wells’s novel The First Men in the Moon (1901). It valourizes science and the idea of research/exploration as an end in itself but also satirizes nineteenth century scientific achievements. Méliès had some ties to the Symbolist movement and included symbolic scenes which comment on but do not further the plot, including the film’s most iconic image -- the rocket hitting the moon in its eye.
