|In the twenty-first century, works of modern art in North Africa     |
|appeared in national museums, private museums, galleries, and        |
|independent exhibit spaces across the region (defined here as        |
|Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt), with the most          |
|significant and well-known of these spaces being the Museum of Modern|
|Art Algiers (MAMA) in Algeria (founded in 2007), and the Museum of   |
|Modern Egyptian Art in Cairo (founded in 1927). However, in the 1950s|
|and 1960s  at the very height of the modern art movement in the     |
|region  there were very few public museum or gallery spaces for     |
|modern art. With the notable exception of Egypt, national museums    |
|across the region were, for the most part, inherited colonial        |
|structures. In line with the colonial logic behind their creation,   |
|these museums tended to display archaeological finds and local arts  |
|that were considered traditional such as pottery, textiles,          |
|illuminated manuscripts, and wood-carvings. As a result, from the    |
|1950s to the 1990s the majority of works by North African modernists |
|were displayed abroad or in small galleries, local salons, fine arts |
|academies, or art festivals. In addition to these spaces, North      |
|African artists worked to create alternative spaces for modern art in|
|street exhibits, art publications, and independent galleries.        |

|Until the 1990s (with the exception of Egypt), there were relatively |
|few state-run or public modern art spaces in North Africa. Those few |
|museums that exhibited modernist works, such as the National Museum  |
|of Fine Arts in Algiers (founded in 1897), exhibited painting        |
|primarily by Europeans and European settlers. In Morocco, six artists|
|from the Casablanca School (an art collective that emerged from the  |
|Casablanca Fine Arts Academy in the early 1960s) attempted to counter|
|this dynamic by educating the local public about modernist art       |
|through large-scale exhibits in squares and marketplaces. Similarly, |
|Moroccan cultural journals Souffles and Integral published           |
|reproductions of modern art from North Africa and the Middle East.   |
|During this time, artists from across the region organised exchange  |
|exhibits and art festivals with colleagues in Iraq, Syria, and       |
|Lebanon. Due to the political environments across the region,        |
|however, many artists lived and practiced in Europe (as was the case |
|for the majority of Libyan modernist artists). In Egypt, there was   |
|more state-support for modern art than in other North African        |
|countries, with numerous state-run galleries and museums serving     |
|Egyptian artists. Building on the work of Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil and |
|the Society of the Friends of Art, for example, the Museum of Modern |
|Egyptian Art in Cairo was officially founded in 1931 with 584 works  |
|of art. Private collections were also more expansive in Egypt than in|
|neighbouring North African countries.                                |
|                                                                     |
|In the 1990s numerous galleries and independent art spaces devoted to|
|modern and contemporary art opened and flourished throughout North   |
|Africa. Among the most notable and recognised are the Galerie Ammar  |
|Farhat (1988) and the Galerie el Marsa (1994) in Tunisia, the        |
|Townhouse Gallery in Cairo (1998), and the Villa des arts in         |
|Casablanca (1999). As of 2013, Morocco and Tunisia were completing   |
|work on two large-scale museums of modern art in their capitals.     |
