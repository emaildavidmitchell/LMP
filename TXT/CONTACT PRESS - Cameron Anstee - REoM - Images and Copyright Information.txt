I believe that the three book covers are public domain based on the copyright information provided in the Contact Press entry at Historical Perspectives in Canadian Publishing. It lists book covers for Contact Press as in the public domain. The images included here are scans of copies on my shelves.

This is an undated advertisement (1956 based on the information it includes). It is in my personal collection. I have no further information about where it appeared or how it was distributed.
