Sawasdi Tantisuk (1925-)

Born in Thonburi, Thailand, Tantisuk is a contemporary of Tawee Nandakwang, having also trained at Silpakorn University and the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome. A prominent figure in early Thai modernism, Tantisuk favoured watercolour, its unforgiving and immediate characters resonating with his approach to art practice which draws on Buddhist philosophy where each action, in this case brushstrokes, cannot be undone. Tantisuk’s early works were in the Impressionist genre, but following his four years in Rome, his work became more abstracted and geometric as he absorbed the then current trends in Western art, with colour and texture being characteristics of many oil paintings of the 1960s. As his career progressed abstraction would remain his favoured approach to painting, though he maintained some realist elements in his watercolour outdoor scenes. Tantisuk used colour to effectively evoke emotion in his works depicting both the serenity and wonder of the natural world and the bustle of Thai urban life. A consistent painter, throughout his career he has received many awards and been consistently involved with the art profession. He received an Honorary PhD from Silpakorn University in 1991, and was Thailand’s National Artist (painting) in 1991.
