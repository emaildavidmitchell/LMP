HSIAO Chin [Xiao Qin] (蕭勤1935–)



Hsiao Chin is an abstract painter who was born in Shanghai, China to an affluent Christian family. His father Hsiao Yu-mei (蕭友梅) founded the Shanghai Conservatorium of Music in 1927. His parents died when he was young, and he moved to Taiwan where, in 1951, he entered the Department of Art Education at the Provincial Taipei Normal School. There he met his mentor Li Chung-sheng (1912-1984李仲生). In 1956 Hsiao became a founding member of the Ton Fan Art Group (Dongfang huahui; Eastern painting group東方畫會). Hsiao Chin had moved to Spain in 1955, by which time his painting was rich in calligraphic marks made in oil. He moved to Italy in 1958 and lived there for 40 years, establishing the Punto movement in 1961 with painters Antonio Calderara (1903 – 1978), Azuma Kenjiro (1926 –) and Li Yuan-chia (1929 – 1994 李元佳). Throughout his life Hsiao investigated Taoism and metaphysics, Zen, the energy of the sun, Tibetan tantrism and Indian mandalas and represented this in his non-figurative works through pure bold colours. Whilst in New York from 1967-1971 he was further influenced by the work of Mark Rothko. Hsiao also wrote for Taiwanese newspapers from abroad communicating art news and trends directly to a Taiwanese audience.
