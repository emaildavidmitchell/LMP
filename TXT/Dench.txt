Dench, Chris(topher) (1953 --)

[header text]

Chris Dench is one of a group of British composers who, emerging in the
early 1980s, were associated, often reluctantly, with the notion of New
Complexity (others included Richard Barrett and James Dillon); the term was
also applied to slightly older composers such as Brian Ferneyhough and
Michael Finnissy. Typical of their works were (and still are) extremely
intricate rhythms, often exquisite and highly personal calligraphy, use of
microtones, and a generally radical approach to instrumental writing that
often placed huge demands on performers.

[main text]

Born in London, Dench is self-taught, but like many of his contemporaries
gained much stimulus from contact with Michael Finnissy, in the latters
roles as both composer and pianist. Following initial years in or around
London, he emigrated to Tuscany in June 1987, and thence to Berlin on New
Years Day 1989 (to take up a DAAD residency) and ultimately to Australia
on Christmas Day of the same year. He became an Australian citizen in 1992.


Whereas many other so-called New Complexity composers often drew on such
archetypally Romantic domains as literature and the visual arts, the
younger Dench mostly looked elsewhere.  Big Bang theories were (and remain)
a natural source of inspiration, but so were topics and writers as diverse
as pinball machines, Japanese shunga erotica, Michael Foucault and Gregory
Bateson, as well as such ostensibly unlikely musicians as New Wave exponent
Thomas Dolby and the early hip-hop guru Afrika Bambaataa (though they left
no immediately discernible stylistic imprints on his work).

Solo works apart (the latter including several remarkable works for flute),
Denchs music typically involves a dense, sometimes even claustrophobic,
polyphony of rhythmically independent individual lines, for which he cites
Charles Ives as an initial and enduring influence. Many characteristic
features of his work are evident in the excerpt below from the blinding
access of the grace of flesh (2003), which, like the earlier ik(s)land[s],
uses texts by the Australian poet berni m janssen, and these go beyond the
stylistic features noted above. The work was written for the ELISION
Ensemble, with whom Dench has collaborated regularly since around 1990, and
typically it is prefaced by two very different quotations: the passage from
Angela Carters Nights at the Circus that gives the work its title, and one
from Consilience, a book by Harvard professor of Entomology Edward O
Wilson, whose discussion of various aspects of memory inspired the works
broad formal structure.

Technically, Dench is a resolute formalist: for every work he prepares
intricately crafted charts, matrices and form-plans. For many years these
pre-compositional designs had consciously cabalistic elements, such as the
use of the letters of personal names to generate not only the structure and
details of works but also, in Denchs view, to significantly affect the
whole aura of a work (especially with solo compositions). Typical details
can be found in Toop 1991 and 1995, referenced below.

Dench sees his works of 1997 as marking a turning-point in his output; the
changes include a reduction of the cabbalistic impulse, an inclination to
define forms in terms of boundary phenomena rather than classically
organicist core systems, a partial retreat from the use of instrumental
extended techniques particularly associated with some of the flute
pieces, and a rapprochement with literature, as well as more speculative
(less hard-core) investigations of time and physical matter, such as
those of Julian Barbours the End of Time.


His works are mainly published by United Music Publishers and the
Australian Music Centre, though some later scores are also directly
available from the composer, whose personal web-page is
