Leung Ping-kwan, MH (pen name: Ye Si) was an influential writer, essayist, and scholar in Hong Kong. Shortly after he was born in Guangdong Province, mainland China, in 1949, his family moved to Hong Kong permanently. 



Leung became a freelancer in the 1960s, and later obtained his Bachelors degree in English at Hong Kong Baptist University. In 1978, he was admitted to the Department of Comparative Literature at the University of California, San Diego. He completed the doctoral degree in 1984. His supervisor was Wai-lim Yip (叶维廉), a poet and a prominent scholar of comparative studies, the co-founder of《文学评论》(a literary magazine), and the friend of Bai Xianyong(白先勇) and Yang Mu(楊牧). Leung’s dissertation is entitled ‘Aesthetics of Opposition: A Study of the Modernist Generation of Chinese Poets, 1936-1949’, in which he examines why and how various kinds of literary experimentation took place between 1936 and 1949 in China. What underpins his project is the idea that literary modernism embodies the spirit of critiquing and innovating different modes of literary writing instead of only yielding new literary techniques (Zhang 20). 



After returning to Hong Kong, he taught in the Department of English Studies and Comparative Literature at the University of Hong Kong. In 1998, he became a professor in the Chinese Department at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. Later on, he worked as the Director of the Centre for Humanities Research at Lingnan Univerisity, teaching film, comparative literature, and modernism among other subjects. As a prolific writer and scholar, he has published fiction, poetry, essays, as well as academic works on films, comparative literature, Chinese modernism, and literature in Hong Kong. He died on 5 January 2013.
