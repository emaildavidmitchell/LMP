Leffler (Edgren), Anne Charlotte, (duchess of Cajanello) (1849-1892)

|Anne Charlotte Leffler was one of the most acclaimed   |[pic]          |
|Swedish women writers of the modern breakthrough in    |               |
|late-nineteenth-century Scandinavia. Joining the circle|               |
|known as Young Sweden, a leading literary movement of  |               |
|the 1880s, she was part of the Ibsen-inspired debate   |               |
|about womens rights, sexual morality, and the         |               |
|normative bourgeois family structure. During her       |               |
|lifetime, Lefflers plays were performed more          |               |
|frequently than Strindbergs, and she was known as a   |               |
|notable salon hostess. After her divorce from Gustaf   |               |
|Edgren in 1889, she married the Italian mathematician  |               |
|Pasquale del Pezzo, duke of Cajanello, and settled in  |               |
|Italy. In 1892 she died of appendicitis at the age of  |               |
|forty-three. In her provocative works, sometimes close |               |
|to popular fiction, Leffler depicts not only           |               |
|dysfunctional middle-class marriages but also          |               |
|nineteenth-century notions of love, in particular      |               |
|eroticism. Her major works are translated into several |               |
|languages, including English, German, Russian, Italian,|               |
|Croatian and Dutch.                                    |               |

Anne Charlotte Leffler was  born  into  a  cultured  Stockholm  family  that
encouraged her to follow her ambitions as a writer. In  1869  she  published
her first collection of  short  stories  Hndelsevis,  using  the  pen  name
Carlot. Her breakthrough success Skdespelerskan,  as  well  as  her  second
play, Pastorsadjunkten, both performed at  the  Royal  Dramatic  theatre  in
Stockholm,  were  presented  as  the  works  of  an  anonymous  author.   In
Skdespelerskan, Leffler addresses questions of gender and gender  roles  as
well as the conflict between marriage and career. With the volumes of  short
stories  and  novels  published  under  the  title  Ur  Lifvet  I-III,   she
established herself as a socio-realistic author, but also  as  an  important
voice in the debate on feminism and the double  standards  of  society.  Her
greatest success on the stage was  her  fourth  play,  Sanna  kvinnor.  This
comedy  is  a  typical  example  of   the   feminist   indignation   drama
(indignationsdrama) of the eighties, discussing both married  womens  right
to property and contemporary gender  roles.  Sonja  Kovalevsky:  Erinringar,
Lefflers last book, is  a  portrait  of  the  Russian  mathematician  Sonja
Kovalevsky (1850-1891), the first female full professor in Northern  Europe.
In collaboration with Kovalevsky,  she  also  wrote  the  drama  Kampen  fr
lyckan.
