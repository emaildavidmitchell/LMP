KIM Ki-chang (1914-2001)
Kim Ki-chang (1914-2001), also known as Unbo, was a modern ink painter who
was born in Seoul. Having lost his hearing from typhoid fever, he was
unable to attend regular art school. However, in 1930, when he was 17 years
old, he became a student of Kim Eun-ho, a well-known traditional ink
(Dongyang-hwa) painter. In 1931, Kim Ki-chang participated in the Joseon
Art Exhibition, an organization established by the Japanese Government-
General in Korea. His painting style of the time was effectively
demonstrated in the delicate contours and thick surface treatment in his
work The Autumn (1935). In 1937, Kim Ki-chang received the Changdeokgung
Award, the highest honour awarded by the Joseon Art Exhibition, for his
work Old Tale. Following Liberation in 1945, Kims painting style was
criticized for being too much like Japanese style painting, so he tried to
remove this influence from his work by adopting bold calligraphic
brushstrokes instead of delicate contours and colouring. He also sometimes
painted abstract paintings using elements from Cubism. In the early 1970s,
Kim Ki-chang adopted primitive elements from Korean folk paintings
(Minhwa), which were popular among Korean people during the Joseon Dynasty.
Red Bird (1977) shows how the artist abandoned elements of Cubism along
with any Western techniques such as the use of perspective or realistic
representation. He described his own paintings as foolish landscapes,
foolish flowers and birds. During his last years, he painted abstract
works in ink with more broad and bold brushstrokes, without being tied to a
certain painting style.
