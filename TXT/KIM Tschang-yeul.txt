KIM Tschang-yeul (1929- )


Kim Tschang-yeul was born in Korea during the Japanese colonial era. After
studying painting at the college of Fine Arts at the Seoul National
University (1948-50), he moved to America and studied printing at the New
York Art Student League (1966-68). His painting style can be divided into
three periods. The first, occurred whilst he was living in Korea from the
late 1950s to the mid 1960s, where he painted in the informel style popular
with young artists of that time, and is epitomised in his work Rite (1965).
The second, short- lived period, was whilst he studied printing at the New
York Art Student League. Here, Kim abandoned Informel and instead developed
works influenced by the abstract paintings displayed in the 1966 Primary
Structures exhibition, working with plexiglass or abstract paintings that
contained minimalistic elements. The third period was from the 1970s
onwards, when he arrived in Paris, where he developed his trademark water
drop paintings. painted on the surface of newspapers or a canvases
realistically in works like Memory (1975), or on a canvas in works like
Water Drops (1979). . From the mid 1980s, he has depicted his water drops
alongside with calligraphy strokes or Chinese characters.
