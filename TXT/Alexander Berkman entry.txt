|Berkman, Alexander                                                   |
|A.K.A. Ovsei Osipovich Berkman, Sasha Berkman                        |
|Alexander Berkman, while largely remote from literary concerns, was  |
|closely connected to a number of key modernist figures, helping to   |
|impart radical concerns to American modernism.                       |
|It would seem odd to include Berkman (November 21, 1870  June 28,   |
|1936), editor of Mother Earth (1907-1918) and The Blast (1916-1917), |
|in a reference work on Modernism: as a lifelong anarchist militant,  |
|jailed for his attempt to assassinate industrialist Henry Clay Frick |
|(1892) and deported for his opposition to WWI (1919), he was neither |
|an author nor a critic of modernist works per se. However, his links |
|to key modernist figures, particularly in New York, are numerous.    |
|Thus, Berkmans Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist (1912) was reviewed In|
|Margaret Andersons Little Review (1914) and lauded by Mabel Dodge   |
|Luhan; his ideas were debated in Dora Marsden and Harriet Shaw       |
|Weavers Egoist (1915-16); and Lola Ridge dedicated a poem each to   |
|Berkman and his lover, Emma Goldman, in Reveille (1920).             |
|Additionally, the Ferrer Center, a popular education initiative      |
|Berkman and Goldman sponsored in New York in 1911, drew participation|
|from such figures as Eugene ONeill, Hart Crane, Isadora Duncan, Jack|
|London, Man Ray, Robert Henri, Upton Sinclair, Wallace Stevens, and  |
|William Carlos Williams. Berkman committed suicide in exile in       |
|France.                                                              |
