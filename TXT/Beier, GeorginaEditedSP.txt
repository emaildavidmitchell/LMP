Beier, Georgina (b. 1938, London)

Georgina Beier was  born  Georgina  Betts  in  1938  in  London,  1938.  She
enrolled at age sixteen in the Kingston Art School.  Fifteen  months  later,
she dropped out of the school, later  claiming  that  had  she  remained  at
school,  the  academic  atmosphere   would   have   impeded   her   personal
development. In 1959, she came to Nigeria, where  she  met  Ulli  Beier  and
eventually became his second wife.

      From 1964, she conducted the annual art workshops at the Mbari  -Mbayo
-Club (Osogbo, Nigeria), also in response to the academic style of  art  she
rejected. She encouraged her students to be  authentic  instead  of  letting
themselves be preoccupied  with  academic  constraints.,  illustrating  This
illustrated Beiers influence on African Mmodernism and its aesthetics.  The
Like Beier, famous artists who emerged from these workshops, such  as  Twins
Seven Seven, Muraina Oyelami, and Rufus Ogundele, were  not  trained  in  an
academic sensenever academically trained.
Beier was also involvedalso participated  in  the  theatre  company  of  the
Mbari -Mbayo Club, painting  the backdrops and designing  the  costumes  for
plays and religious ceremonies, and  had  and  impacted  an  impact  on  the
visual culture there.

Beier relocated with her husband to  several  places,  including  Papua  New
Guinea, Australia, India and Germany, where she continued to  run  workshops
with local artists, and her  own  artistic  practice,  including  paintings,
sculptures, textiles, lithographs, furniture  design,  murals,  mosaics  and
illustrations for publications by Ulli Beier.
