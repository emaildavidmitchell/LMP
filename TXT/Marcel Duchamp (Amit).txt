Marcel Duchamp was a prominent artist, and an influential figure in aesthetics, the philosophy of art, and experimental cinema. In 1924 he collaborated with artist Man Ray and composer Erik Satie on René Clair’s film Entr'acte. Two years later, Duchamp directed Anémic cinema (1926), a short experimental film that further explores themes he explored in other media, including sculpture and painting. In it, Duchamp used for the first time spinning discs he called Rotoreliefs, on which various geometrical designs and printed words were placed, showcasing his interest in optical illusions and mechanical art. In 1943, he collaborated with renowned American experimental filmmaker, Maya Deren, on a short film they never finished, Witch's Cradle. The film was meant to explore fantastical elements in Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of this Century Gallery, where other works by Duchamp were exhibited. In 1957, Duchamp co-directed with German artist Hans Richter (who previously directed a film based on Duchamp’s work, Dreams That Money Can Buy, 1947), and famous French writer and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, the film 8 × 8: A Chess Sonata in 8 Movements. The work portrayed the unconscious of chess, a game about which Duchamp had a life-long passion.
