Dear Stephen (and Allana),

Prathana Purkayasthana has gone ahead and secured copyright for the images she wishes to include with her entry on Manjushri and Ranjabi Sircar. I am including written permission below for your reference and for you to pass along to whoever at Routledge is handling copyright.



I've also included the photos. I doubt Routledge is ready for them yet, but here they are in case you need them.



Best,

Janet

Dear Prarthana:



Yes you may use my photos with photo credit -- photos by Avinash Pasricha.



What do you have--prints or scanned images? If the quality is not good

enough for printing,

then let me know the numbers or email the images and I will see what I can

do.



Best Wishes and Regards

Subject: Permission to use your images



Dear Avinash,

I hope this email finds you well. It has been a while since we last met,

which was several years ago at your photo shoot with Dancers' Guild in

Kolkata. I am currently working as a Lecturer in Theatre in Performance at

University of Plymouth, UK, and have recently been asked to contribute an

entry on the Sircars in an Encyclopedia which will be published by

Routledge next year.

I have with me a couple of images from your photo shoot which I would very

much like to use as part of my academic entry on Manjusri and Ranjabati

Sircar. I was therefore wondering if you could kindly give me permission

to use these images in print. In exchange, I can request the editor to

send you a copy of the Encyclopedia once it has been published. Please let

me know if this is okay with you?

I hope to hear from you at your earliest convenience.

Bests,

Prarthana
