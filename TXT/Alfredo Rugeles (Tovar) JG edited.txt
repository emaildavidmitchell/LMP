Rugeles, Alfredo (1949- )

Roberto Ojeda Tovar

The Venezuelan maestro Alfredo Rugeles was born in Washington, DC, on 13
December 1949, while his parents were on diplomatic service. Composer,
conductor, lecturer, and pedagogue, his 30 years at the podium give
testament to Rugeles brilliant and varied career as an orchestra
conductor. Artistic Director of the Simon Bolivar Symphonic Orchestra since
1991, Rugeles is frequently invited to conduct renowned ensembles
throughout the world, including Europe and North, Central and South
America.

Rugeles is recognized as an opera and concert conductor of refined taste,
accompanying world-class soloists such as Paul Badura-Skoda, Montserrat
Caball, Alexis Crdenas, Chick Corea, Alirio Daz, Monique Duphil, Jane
Eaglen, Natalia Gutman, Maurice Hasson, Frans Helmerson, Franois Le Roux,
Aquiles Machado, Wynton Marsalis, Shlomo Mintz, Gabriela Montero, Jorge
Luis Prats, Ruggiero Ricci, Mstislav Rostropovitch, Edison Ruiz, and Renata
Scotto, among many others.

Rugeles has been the Musical Director of the Teresa Carreo Theatre (1997-
2000), Associate Conductor and Artistic Director of the Caracas Municipal
Symphonic Orchestra (1982-1987), founder and conductor of the Nova Musica
Ensemble, and Director of the Venezuelan Chamber Orchestra Foundation.
Since 2009, he has conducted the Simon Bolivar Latin American Ensemble of
Contemporary Music.

In 2000, for the 70th anniversary of the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra,
Rugeles recorded his first CD as a conductor, along with the pianists Edith
Pea and Arnaldo Pizzolante. During 2002 and 2003, he recorded seven other
CDs with the same orchestra.

A recognized composer, he has a brief catalogue that includes chamber,
choral, symphonic and electroacoustic works. He has received national
recognitions such as the Caro de Boesi Composition Prize (1979) and the
Municipal Music Prize (1985) for his pieces Somosnueve (for chamber
ensemble) and Tanguitis (for piano solo), respectively. Rugeles music has
been edited and recorded by several labels, including Boosey and Hawkes,
and performed all over Latin America, as well as in North America, Western
and Eastern Europe, and Hong Kong.

Rugeles has a wide-ranging and varied musical background that includes
diplomas in Voice and Choral Conducting as well as studies in Composition
with Yannis Ioannidis in Caracas, and in Composition and Orchestral
Conducting at the Robert Schumann Institute in Dsseldorf, under Gnther
Becker and Wolfgang Trommer. In 1993, Rugeles was elected member of the
Executive Committee of the International Society for Contemporary Music,
ISCM, and then re-elected in 1995. He is a founder and president (1999 
2003) of the Venezuelan Society for Contemporary Music, SVMC. His profound
interest and devotion to spreading the music of the twentieth and twenty-
first centuries spurred him to organize 11 editions (to date) of the Latin
American Music Festival, which began in 1991. He has given international
conducting workshops with Sergiu Celibidache, Michel Tabachnik and Franco
Ferrara. Numerous composers have dedicated their work to Rugeles, including
the Venezuelan composers Diana Arismendi (1962- ), Josefina Benedetti (1953-
), Beatriz Bilbao (1951-), Inocente Carreo (1919- ) and Federico Ruiz
(1948- ), and the Latin American composers Manuel De Elas (Mexico), Guido
Lpez Gaviln (Cuba), Marlos Nobre (Brazil), Carlos Vzquez (Puerto Rico)
and Alberto Villalpando (Bolivia).
