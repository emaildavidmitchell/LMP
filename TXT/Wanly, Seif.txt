Born in Alexandria, Egypt, Seif Wanly is a leading figure of Egyptian
modern art. Together with his younger brother, Adham Wanly, they were among
the first Alexandrian artists to depict international subjects, such as
circus, ballet, opera, music concerts, theatreer performances and bull
fighting. The Wanly brothers studied under the Italian painter Ottorino
Bicchi (1878-1949) in 1929 before they established their own studio in
Alexandria in 1935. During the 1950s, they travelled regularly to Europe
and visited France, Italy and Spain. In 1957, they were appointed
professors at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Alexandria. Seif Wanly was a
prolific artist and his work shared an affinity with the cole de Barbizon,
as well as with cubism and fauvism. When his brother Adham passed away in
1959, he went through a difficult period of his life, which was reflected
in his work.
