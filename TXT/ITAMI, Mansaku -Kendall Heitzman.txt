ITAMI, Mansaku (2 January 1900  21 September 1946)

Itami Mansaku was a Japanese film director, screenwriter, and essayist,
known for bringing contemporary social issues into Japanese period films in
the 1930s.  He made his debut as a director in 1928 and went on to direct
twenty-two films, many of them samurai dramas with modern psychology and a
wry touch.  In Akanishi Kakita (1936), perhaps the most famous of these,
the title character is a samurai who makes his way in the world through wit
alone.  Together with German director Arnold Fanck, Itami directed
Atarashiki tsuchi (The New Earth, 1937; German: Die Tochter des Samurai
(The Daughter of the Samurai)), but the liberal Itami disagreed with Fanck
over the direction of the film and they produced two different versions.
During World War II, Itami was privately and publicly critical of the
jingoism he perceived in his own culture.  After the war, Itami was equally
critical of those too quick to adjust to postwar democracy under the Allied
Occupation.  In his famous 1946 essay Concerning War Responsibility,
Itami remarks that everyone is willing to proclaim that they were the
deceived during the war, but none are willing to admit that they were
themselves deceivers.  He is the father of Itami Jz, the director of
Tanpopo (Tampopo, 1985) and other rambunctious comedies of the 1980s and
1990s.
