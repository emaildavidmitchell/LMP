Kishida, Ryûsei (岸田劉生) (1891 - 1929 ) 





Kishida Ryûsei was a Yôga artist whose works have been designated as Important Cultural Properties. He studied under Kuroda Seiki ( 黒田清輝1886 – 1924), a leading Yôga advocate and started exhibiting at the government-sponsored Bunten exhibition in 1910. Kishida was influenced by the post-Impressionist movement and became friends with Mushanokôji Saneatsu (武者小路　実篤,　1885 - 1976) and members of the White Birch Society, known as the Shirakaba (白樺派 1910 - 1923). The society was made up of literary members like Mushanokôji and was highly influential in art circles through its introduction of avant-garde trends and news from France. The society produced a journal, Shirakaba, which was highly circulated and coveted among Yôga painting circles. In 1912, Kishida along with sculptor and poet, Takamura Kôtarô, formed the Fusain-kai (フュウザン会 ). The society was conceived to be anti-Bunten and encouraged artists to focus on self-expression and individualism. As the Fusain-kai did not have a clear manifesto, its activities lasted only a year before Kishida went on to establish another society known as the Grass and Earth Society (草土社,  Sôdosha, 1915- 1922) which advocated realism through art. 

In 1918, Kishida started painting a series of portraits based on his young daughter, Reiko. It was believed that he worked on them while he was recuperating from an illness and that during this period, his daughter would often pose for him. Reiko Laughing (麗子微笑 1921) is designated an Important Cultural Property. Kishida is most known for his portraits, some of which show clear influences from Van Gogh and Cezanne. Apart from such portraits, Kishida also took an interest in Nihonga, Chinese Paintings and Ukiyo-e. He also authored several books on art and aesthetics.  Although Kishida was best known for his portraits, he also painted still lives and landscapes. A Road Cut through a Hill (道路と土手と塀, 1915) is an example of a landscape work that is also designated as Important Cultural Property.
