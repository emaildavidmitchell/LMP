IMAMURA, Shohei (September 15, 1926 – May 30, 2006)



Imamura Shohei was one of the pillars of postwar Japanese cinema as a key player in the Japanese New Wave. His filmmaking career started at the Shochiku studio in 1951 as an assistant director for Ozu Yasujiro, whose style of directing Imamura found too rigid. He left Shochiku to join Nikkatsu in 1954, where he worked under Kawashima Yuzo, co-authoring the script of Bakumatsu taiyoden (Sun in the Last Days of the Shogunate, 1957). From his directorial debut with Nusumareta yokujo (Stolen Desire, 1958), Imamura's films explored such issues as fundamental human desire and sexual perversity in Hateshinaki yokubo (Endless Desire, 1958), complex anti-American sentiment in Buta to gunkan (Pigs and Battleships, 1961), female characters at the lower level of the social hierarchy in Nippon konchuki (Insect Woman, 1963) and Akai satsui (Intentions of Murder, 1964), and Japanese folklore and myths in Kamigami no fukaki yokubo (Profound Desire of the Gods, 1968). Imamura’s distinctive methodology was often described as being naturalist, deriving from an ethnographic viewpoint through which cinematic imagination was rendered. He pursued his unique filmmaking style further across the boundaries of generic convention and medium when he embarked on several ambitious documentary projects with Ningen johatsu (A Man Vanishes, 1967 in collaboration with the Art Theatre Guild) and a series of TV documentaries he undertook from the 1970s. In his later career, Imamura became one of a few internationally celebrated auteurs to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes twice with Narayama bushiko (The Ballard of Narayama, 1983) and Unagi (The Eel, 1991).
