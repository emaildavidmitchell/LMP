|The British critic Roger Fry devised the term Post-Impressionism in    |
|1910 while organising an exhibition in London at the Grafton Galleries |
|to introduce recent French art to the British public. For him,         |
|Post-Impressionism included painters who consider the Impressionists  |
|too naturalistic (Manet and the Post-Impressionists 7). He argued that|
|Post-Impressionist painters privileged the simplicity of form and the  |
|expression of emotions over the Impressionists tendency to capture    |
|mere shimmer and colour (Manet and the Post-Impressionists 9). Fry   |
|singled out Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Czanne for their |
|efforts to advance Impressionism. An exhibition at the Museum of Modern|
|Art in New York in 1929, organised by Alfred H. Barr, Jr. added Georges|
|Seurat to the core group of Post-Impressionists. Barr declared that    |
|through their artistic innovations, all four artists had emerged from  |
|the Impressionist blind-alley (The Museum of Modern Art 12). While   |
|subsequent exhibitions and publications have attempted to broaden the  |
|range of artists that could be considered Post-Impressionists (for     |
|example, an exhibition organised by the Royal Academy of Arts in London|
|in 1979), Georges Seurat, Gauguin, van Gogh, and Czanne continue to be|
|celebrated as the artists that made the most noteworthy contributions  |
|to Post-Impressionism, forging the way to Fauvism, Cubism,             |
|Expressionism, and beyond.                                             |

|The emergence of Post-Impressionism is closely aligned with the demise |
|of Impressionism. In 1886, Impressionist artists organised their eighth|
| and what was to become their final  exhibition.  Twelve years after |
|their first exhibition in 1874, the Impressionists found themselves    |
|beginning to diverge, as they, their critics, and other artists began  |
|to look for new means of artistic expression that depended less on     |
|optical effects and more on underlying structure and form. For one     |
|younger artist, Georges Seurat, the solution was to instil             |
|Impressionist subject matter  scenes of everyday life  with a sense  |
|of permanence, derived from classical precedents. Seurat developed a   |
|new method of applying paint based on colour theory. Forsaking the     |
|loose brushstrokes of the Impressionists, he replaced them with small  |
|dots in complementary colours, which were applied tightly and          |
|systematically. Seurat introduced his new method, which he called      |
|Chromo-luminarism, at the 1886 Impressionist exhibition, alongside work|
|in the same manner by fellow artists Paul Signac and Camille Pissarro. |
|The critic Flix Fnon dubbed the new technique Neo-Impressionism,    |
|while Signac favoured Divisionism. Other critics, however, coined the  |
|term Pointillism, and it is by this name that the method is usually    |
|known.                                                                 |
|                                                                       |
|Paul Gauguin, who began exhibiting with the Impressionists in 1879,    |
|also sought ways to rejuvenate painting during the 1880s. He initially |
|found direction through the work of a younger artist, mile Bernard,   |
|whom he met in Brittany. Gauguin emulated Bernards style of painting, |
|which involved applying patches of bright, flat, non-naturalistic      |
|colour onto the canvas, surrounded by dark contours. Known as          |
|Cloisonnism, the styles name came from its resemblance to cloisonn   |
|enamel work. The appeal of Cloisonnisim to Gauguin was its rejection of|
|the illusion of three-dimensionality, and its expressive potential. To |
|set his work apart from Bernards, Gauguin deemed his new mode of      |
|working Synthetism, by which he meant painting that did not simply     |
|privilege subject matter but also emphasised form and feeling. His     |
|years spent in Tahiti inspired work incorporating subjects and motifs  |
|from the more primitive world that Gauguin sought out as he rejected |
|European materialism. His increasing insistence on depicting scenes    |
|sparked by ideas, emotions, and visions linked him to the writers and  |
|painters of the European Symbolist movement.                           |
|                                                                       |

|The Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh arrived in Paris in 1886. Prior to  |
|his move to Paris, van Gogh produced paintings in a dark palette that  |
|depicted scenes of rural life. Once in Paris, his paintings lightened  |
|considerably, and for a short period he experimented with the          |
|Pointillist method. Like other artists he met, he also found           |
|inspiration in Japanese prints. In 1888, tired of Paris, van Gogh moved|
|to Arles, in the south of France, where his palette intensified under  |
|the bright Provenal sun. Gauguin joined him there for a short time.   |
|Like Gauguin, van Gogh favoured arbitrary, non-naturalistic colours,   |
|although he differed in that his work continued to spring from scenes  |
|he saw before him, rather than from his imagination. Nonetheless, van  |
|Goghs paintings took on an otherworldly quality, permeated with       |
|emotional, expressive energy that made inanimate objects and scenery   |
|seem almost alive. Van Goghs insistence on the symbolic value of      |
|colour, and his use of colour to express his emotions, held particular |
|appeal for Symbolist writers and artists.                              |
|                                                                       |
|Paul Czanne was affiliated with the Impressionists from as early as   |
|1874, when he exhibited his paintings in the first Impressionist       |
|exhibition. However, his work was not well received and he began to    |
|spend increasing time in his birthplace, Aix-en-Provence, in the south |
|of France. There he attempted to correct what he found lacking in      |
|Impressionism. Focussing on still life paintings and landscapes,       |
|Czanne developed a new approach to painting that stood in opposition  |
|to the prevailing Impressionist style: rather than trying to capture   |
|his optical impressions on the canvas, he aimed to depict the          |
|underlying solidity of the objects or scenes before him, by            |
|methodically building form through colour. Most provocatively, Czanne |
|deliberately broke the rules of perspective; instead, he tried to mimic|
|on canvas the actual movements of the human eye, by portraying surfaces|
|from a number of different viewpoints.                                 |
|                                                                       |

|None of these artists gained widespread recognition in their lifetimes.|
|However, by challenging the central tenets of Impressionism, each      |
|contributed in his own way to the emergence of modern art in the early |
|twentieth century. Alfred H. Barr, Jr. summed up their contributions   |
|through a chart he developed in 1936, where he plotted out the means by|
|which their bold experiments paved the way to Fauvism, Cubism,         |
|Expressionism, and, ultimately, to Abstract Art.                       |
