Herwarth Walden (Georg Levin, 1878-1941)

Herwarth Walden was the force behind Der Sturm, an avant-garde journal,
gallery, performance venue, bookstore, and theater school in Berlin (1910-
1932). Waldens first wife, the poet Else Lasker-Schler, whose works he
set to music, bestowed the utopian name on him. Walden founded the journal,
Der Sturm, in 1910. His contacts through Lasker-Schler, his piano teacher
Conrad Ansorge, and the Viennese writer Karl Kraus and architect Adolf Loos
ensured the journals success. Expressionist writers such as Alfred Dblin
and August Stramm debuted in its pages. In 1912, Walden opened Der Sturm
gallery, which hosted Expressionist, Futurist, Cubist, and Constructivist
art exhibitions. Walden increased the visibility of female artists, such as
Sonia Delaunay and Gabriele Mnter, and Wassily Kandinsky and Kurt
Schwitters gained renown at his gallery. Yet in the 1920s, Waldens uncanny
capacity to recognize talent diminished, and Der Sturm ceased publication
in 1932. Walden emigrated to the Soviet Union, where he sought a communist
utopia, only to die in a Stalinist camp in 1941.
