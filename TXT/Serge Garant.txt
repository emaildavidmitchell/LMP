Introductory thumbnail
      Composer, conductor, teacher, radio host, artistic director and music
critic, Serge Garant has been one of the main figures in the Canadian
contemporary music landscape. His early works bore the influences of
Messiaen and Boulez, and his maturity style was that of a complex alloy
between the rigorous post-serialism structural tendencies and controlled
indeterminacy. Lyrical by nature, the music of Serge Garant is a rich
testimony of a search for a balance between rigor and intuition, a goal
shared by several composers of his generation.

Expository entry
      Serge Garant is a French Canadian composer born on September 22nd
1929. He first studied piano with Sylvio Lacharit, harmony with Paul-
Marcel Robidoux and played the clarinet for the Sherbrooke Symphony
Orchestra, before pursuing his musical training further in Montreal, where
he took piano lessons with Yvonne Hubert and studied composition with well-
known pedagogue Claude Champagne (1891-1965). In the fall of 1951, he
studied in France for half a year. There, he studied counterpoint with
Andre-Vaurabourg-Honegger and attended Messiaens already famous analysis
class, along with Canadian composer Clermont Ppin and the young Karlheinz
Stockhausen. At that moment, he explored major works of early twentieth
century composers such as Debussy and Berg; these discoveries were added to
that of Schnbergs piano music, which he had learned to play by himself in
Sherbrooke, the year before. He also became familiar with Messiaens modes
of limited transposition and rhythmical theories, and was deeply impressed
by Boulezs Second piano sonata (1948); both these composers have had a
major influence on Garants conceptions of musical creation. The two first
melodies of the cycle Concerts sur Terre, in which Messiaens harmonic
influence is clearly at work - although Garant did not use his specific
scales - were composed at that time; the cycle would only be completed in
1956 in a voluntarily homogenuous style, in spite of the aesthetic
evolution he had by then undergone.
      In 1953, Serge Garant moved to Montreal where he worked as a
versatile pianist and eventually as an arranger for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Simultaneously, he began the composition of
the vocal cycle Caprices, that inscribes itself in that same generalised
serialism fashion that generated Boulezs Le marteau sans matre (1954) and
Stockhausens first four Klavierstcke (1954). In February 1954, he
strongly responded, in the avant-garde journal LAutorit, to a virulent
article of the Montreal music critic Jean Vallerand, who had just written a
polemic text that presented serialism as music for the deaf. That same
year, on the first of May, Garant organised a concert of modern and avant-
garde music with fellow composers Franois Morel and Gilles Tremblay,
featuring works by Messiaen, Boulez and Webern, mostly heard for the first
time in Canada. Works by the three young Quebec composers where also
performed, including Garants four Caprices melodies, then heard for the
first time. The concerts attendance is believed to have reached over six
hundred, a considerable achievement for the period. Exactly a year later,
on May 1st 1955, the same composers and some of their friends offered
another concert, this time a commemoration of the tenth anniversary of
Anton Weberns death. Was then premiered Garants Nucleogame, believed to
be the first canadian work for instruments and tape. In 1956, he became
involved, as a pianist, with Musique de notre temps, an ensemble that was
only active for two seasons. Simultaneously, as a composer, he continued to
explore generalised serialism (Asymtries n1, 1958), and slowly turned
toward what he called controlled indeterminacy, which consists in
methodically conceived and highly structured scores, that allowed
performers some degree of choice. This evolution in Garants compositional
process was first developed in the late 1950s Pice pour quatuor  cordes
(1958) and in Cage doiseau (1962), for soprano and piano.
      Although a considerable proportion of the composers catalogue was
produced in the 1950s, he really became a prominent figure in 1961, during
the Semaine internationale de musique actuelle de Montral, a week long
music happening organised by Canadian composer Pierre Mercure, in which
many important figures of North American and European contemporary music
took part (Cage, Feldman, Brown, etc). Garants Anerca (1961, rev. in
1963), for soprano and chamber ensemble, based on Inuit poems, was then
premiered under the baton of Mauricio Kagel and made great impression
amongst the other composers. From then on, Garants reputation grew
considerably as to become one of the most important leading figures of
Quebecs avant-garde music scene.
      When Pierre Mercure accidentally died in January 1966, Garant was
chosen to replace him as main conductor of the newly founded Socit de
musique contemporaine du Qubec (SMCQ), Canadas very first ensemble
devoted to contemporary music. As the leading figure of the SMCQ, Garant
performed music from around the world, including many first auditions of
canadian works. He also contributed to extend canadian musics reputation
in many countries by conducting the SMCQ ensemble in Europe (1972) and
America (1977). In 1967, Serge Garant joined the leading staff of the
Universit de Montrals music faculty, where he taught composition and
music analysis, with a focus on the post-webernian serial repertoire. His
profound convictions that new music shall be thoroughly structurated had a
strong impact on his students, even on those who questioned or rejected it.
At that time, he was also heard once a week as presenter of Musique de
notre sicle (1971-1986), a CBC radio program. He truly excelled in this
role, bringing historical context to major twenthieth century masterpieces
and providing listeners with cues to understanding recent works by living
composers of international status. Conductor, teacher and communicator :
Serge Garant occupied these functions from the mid 1960s to the time of
his death, on November 1st 1986.
      As a composer, Serge Garant produced many cycles of vocal and
instrumental music. Following the two songs cycles already mentioned, i.e.,
Concerts sur Terre (1951,1956) and Caprices (1954), he wrote in the 1960s
Phrases I (1967) and Phrases II (1968); he then began a major cycle of
three compositions entitled Offrande, (1969, 1970, 1971), based on
proportions taken from the main theme of Bachs Musikalisches Opfer. These
important works were followed by a second triptych entitled Circuit, (1972,
1972, 1973) which pushed even further the conceptual process inspired by
the material developed in the three Offrandes. Other significant works by
Serge Garant are Amuya (1968), chant damours (1975), Rivages (1976),
Quintette (1978) and Plages (1981).
      In all of his mature works, Garant remained a lyrical composer, always
in search of a way to make sounds sing, as he himself used to say. In
his music, as well as in his spoken and written words (as a radio host, in
interviews and in his published texts) he attacked conservative stagnation
in a cultural landscape where catholicism was still deeply rooted, and
criticised folklorism as a mean to define Canadian musical identity in a
broad way, and specifically Quebecs own particularities. He also claimed
the recognition, on the international music scene, of the works composed by
his French Canadian colleagues, a repertoire that he considered equal in
quality to that of many composers of the highest reputation in the world.
Garant defended conceptual rigor and a search for new musical structures,
while denouncing the inert repetitions of extinguished past forms. Above
all, he favored artistic necessity and contemporary means of expression
over the confort of conventional romantic and post-romantic lyricisms. In
many ways, as music critic Gilles Potvin wrote in 1979, on the occasion of
the composers 50th birthday, Serge Garant could well have been that long
awaited composer, equivalent in music to Quebec revolutionary painter Jean-
Claude Borduas (1905-1960), that he had, at the beginning of his career,
wished for in his writings. He embodied the spirit of a new generation of
composers, born, in his view, in a musical culture that had only recently
reached its first maturity, and that still searched its way to the
culminating point of a momentarily attained perfection, ideologically
conceived.
