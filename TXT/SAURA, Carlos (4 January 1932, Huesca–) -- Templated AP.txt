Carlos Saura, screenwriter and film director, has often been praised as representing the summit of the Spanish post-war filmic universe. His film style throughout his career resembles an elliptical and poetic language, used not just for political reasons, but also out of his modernist willingness to pursue aesthetic innovation.

Carlos Saura, screenwriter and film director, has often been praised as representing the summit of the Spanish post-war filmic universe. His film style throughout his career resembles an elliptical and poetic language, used not just for political reasons, but also out of his modernist willingness to pursue aesthetic innovation. His filmography consists of about forty movies that can be divided into three periods in terms of style. The first is exemplified by Los golfos (The Delinquents, 1960), which was influenced by Italian Neorealism, and La caza (The Hunt, 1966), an allegory of the Franco dictatorship that uses the codes of the psychological thriller. The second period, with eight films, makes use of ‘subjective realism’ in line with modernism’s rejection of realism. Beginning with El jardín de las delicias (The Garden of Delights, 1970), this period is marked by Cría cuervos (Cria! 1975), winner of the Jury Prize at Cannes, and Elisa vida mía (1977), a film exhibiting a mannerist and poetic realism. During this period he had a long emotional and professional relationship with Geraldine Chaplin. Finally, in the third period, he pays attention, among others themes, to different Iberian and Latin-American musical styles (flamenco, fado and tango). In the early twenty-first century, he paid tribute to two artists related to modernism: Goya in Goya en Burdeos (Goya in Bordeaux, 1999) and Buñuel in Buñuel y la mesa del rey Salomón (Bunuel and King Solomon's Table, 2001). 33 días (Guernica 33 Days, 2013), released in 2014, refers to the thirty-three days that another modernist icon, Picasso, took to finish Guernica (1937).
