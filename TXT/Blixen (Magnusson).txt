Karen Blixen was a singular figure in 20th century Danish literary life. In
the 1930s, when Blixen started writing, Danish literature was dominated by
social realism centred on the contemporary world. Blixen nourished the myth
of herself as the timeless aristocratic storyteller who wrote her works
independently of her own historical context. However, by drawing lines to
Nietzsche, existentialism, and psychology, Blixen scholars have clearly
demonstrated that she belongs to modernism. As her contemporary Samuel
Becket, she was a bilingual author (she wrote her works in English and
Danish).

Karen Blixens life can be divided into three different phases: During the
first (1903-1913), Blixen studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts
in Copenhagen and wrote her first works under the pseudonym Osceola. The
second begins in 1914, when she moved to Kenya (British East Africa) with
Bror Blixen. The two were separated in 1921, leaving Karen Blixen to run
the coffee farm at Ngong Hills alone until financial problems forced her to
sell it in 1932. Finally, in 1931, Blixen returned to Denmark and remained
at the family manor Rungstedlund until her death in 1962. During this third
phase, Blixen established herself as an author of international stature.
After her time in the British colony, Blixen wrote many of her works in
English. This applies to her 1934 international debut, Seven Gothic Tales
(Danish title: Syv fantastiske Fortllinger), published under the pseudonym
Isak Dinesen. The tale was Blixens preferred literary genre and three
additional collections followed: Winters Tales (Vinter-Eventyr) in 1942,
Last Tales (Sidste Eventyr) in 1957, and Anecdotes of Destiny (Skbne-
Anekdoter) in 1958. In spite of her tales setting in well-defined 19th and
18th century venues, they are only seemingly traditional realistic
narratives. Blixens characters are puppets in cosmic dramas with far-
reaching existential implications. The characters are often confronted with
catastrophic events. Both on the existential and aesthetical level, it is
the narrative itself (e.g. a mythological pattern) which gives meaning to
an often tragic existence.
           Blixens autobiographical writings constitute another important
part of her oeuvre. In 1937 she published Out of Africa where she condensed
her almost twenty years in Africa into five representative stories. Through
this literary strategy Blixen succeeds in giving a sensual and powerfully
personal image of her perception of the African mindset, culture, and
nature.
           Blixens charismatic personality attracted the attention of
several prominent intellectual young men in the 1940s and 50s. They saw her
both as an inspiring and as a demonic figure, an image that has become a
part of the Blixen myth. The many biographies, dissertations,
documentaries, and cinematic adaptations dedicated to Blixen since her
death demonstrate the fascination which her life and works continue to
exert.
