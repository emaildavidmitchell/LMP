Bergelson, Dovid (August 12th, 1884 – August 12th, 1952)





Dovid Bergelson around 1910



Dovid Bergelson was a major Yiddish prose writer and essayist. He had a lasting impact on Yiddish fiction writing, introducing new narrative techniques such as free indirect discourse. He brought literary creation in Yiddish to new heights, appropriating the language for the purposes of an Impressionist, high literary style. He was also a prolific essayist, committed to the notion of the social role of the writer, and to the ideals of Yiddishism, the creation of a new secular Yiddish culture in the name of a Jewish national project rooted in Eastern Europe and distinct from Zionism. These political ideals partly explain Bergelson’s conversion to Soviet state socialism in 1926: in his view, the Soviet Union was the only place compatible with the Yiddishist project. He settled there permanently in 1934. His later literary production radically differed from his earlier writings, and conformed to the doctrine of Socialist Realism. In 1942, he joined the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, supporting the Soviet war effort against Nazi Germany. After the war, Stalin turned against the Committee: Bergelson was arrested in 1949, then executed on August 12th, 1952 together with twelve other Jewish writers and intellectuals.

Timeline of Life and Works



1884: Born in Okhrimovo, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire).



1898: He moves to Kiev. He starts writing in Hebrew and Russian, switching to Yiddish shortly thereafter.



1909: His first novella, Arum Vokzal (At the Depot), is published in Warsaw.



1913: He publishes Nokh alemen (The End of Everything), his most famous novel.



1917: The Russian Revolutions of February and October deeply affect the Ukrainian Jewish bourgeoisie, his target audience and literary topic. 



1918: He becomes a member of the central committee of the Kiev-based Kultur-lige (League of Culture), an organization advocating for a new secular left-wing Yiddish culture.



1921: He moves to Berlin, where he will reside until the early 1930s, with occasional travels to the United States and the Soviet Union. 



1926: He professes his full support for the Soviet Union, and publishes the essay Dray tsentern (Three Centers), in which he claims that Yiddish culture can only thrive in Moscow, as opposed to reactionary Warsaw and assimilationist New York. 



1934: He settles permanently in the Soviet Union. He travels to the newly-established Jewish Autonomous Region of Birobidzhan (Russian Far East), which he thought would provide a new homeland for the Jewish people within the Soviet Union. In Moscow, he attends the First Congress of Soviet Writers, in which Andrei Zhdanov proclaims Socialist Realism as “the official style of Soviet culture”. His later writings conform to these principles, for instance Birobidzhaner (People of Birobidzhan), published that same year. 



1942: He becomes a member of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, designed to garner international support for the Soviet war effort against Nazi Germany.



1949: All surviving members of the Committee are arrested.



August 12th, 1952: He is executed together with twelve other Jewish artists and intellectuals.







Dovid Bergelson’s earlier novels and short stories deal with the advent of a new Ukrainian Jewish bourgeoisie, one increasingly at odds with the values of traditional rural Jewish communities. He describes the slow descent of the latter, but also satirizes the nouveaux riches. His nuanced, Impressionist style conveys his ambiguous take on the subject: the narrative constantly shifts between internal and external perspective, adopting the (often irreconcilable) points of view of multiple characters. This technique allows Bergelson to expose contradictions and social tensions: the conflict between tradition and modernity remains unsolved, leaving Bergelson’s characters prey to angst and self-doubt. Mirel, the main character of his 1913 novel Nokh alemen (The End of Everything), exemplifies this sense of disorientation. Unable to leave her small town, she hesitates between different paths without being able to fully commit to one. The second half of Bergelson’s career, influenced by Socialist Realism, privileged clear political statements. However, recent scholarship by Joseph Sherman and Gennady Estraikh suggests that Bergelson never entirely conformed to the Socialist Realist dogma, distancing himself from its monolithic utopian narrative in a number of ways.
