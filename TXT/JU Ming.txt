JU Ming (1938-)
JU Ming, also known as Ju Chuantai, is one the most prominent Taiwanese
sculptors to have emerged in the later half of the 20th century. Born in
Miaoli County in Northern Taiwan, he originally trained in wood sculpture,
carving traditional figures such as those of the Buddha and Mazu, the sea
goddess.  In 1968, he decided to shift his focus to the depiction of modern
themes. He studied with the famous sculptor Yang Yuyu, who suggested he
change his name from Ju Chuangtai to Ju Ming to signify this change in
artistic direction.  Jus early works explored aspects of Taiwanese folk
life, often depicting farmers, domestic animals or oxcarts. His geometric
and abstract style of artistic execution was often compared to the vivid
and expressive Xieyi () brush technique in Chinese ink-wash painting.
His works were also praised for their ability to combine Chinese folk
culture and artistic traditions with modern sensibilities. He attracted
great attention from both the public and critics at his first solo show at
National Museum of History in 1976. In 1971, following the expulsion of the
ROC from the United Nations, his works were seen as representing Taiwans
artistic spirit and its nativist cultural movement.

Jus work In One Heart (, 1976),  depicting  a  hard-working  farmer
and his ox struggling  to  move  forward  in  muddy  soil,  represented  the
difficult situation in which Taiwanese society found itself  at  that  time,
and encouraged its people to work together to tackle the  problems  relating
to this loss of international political recognition.

Jus Taichi Series (, 1976-77) involved a number of  works  inspired
by the Chinese martial  art  and  became  his  most  recognized  works  both
nationally and internationally. In 1977, he exhibited at the  Tokyo  Central
Art Museum, before travelling to New York in 1980, to pursue his studies  in
modern art. Here he developed a new style  described  as  the  Living  World
Series (, 1980-) that described the life styles of modern people  in
a humorous and colorful way.
