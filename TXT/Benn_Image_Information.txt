1) The image of Benn with the microscope from 1934 is available as part of the creative commons through Wikipedia. It comes from the Bundesarchiv. Information is here:

2) I found the image of Bennâ€™s Morgue pamphlet on the internet,

I have not been able to find additional information or who owns rights, if anyone (has copyright expired by now?). 





3) The cover page of the Statische Gedichte is from the edition owned by the University of Michigan, which I scanned.



The edition is from the Arche Verlag in Zurich. Not sure if they would have to sign off on its use.
