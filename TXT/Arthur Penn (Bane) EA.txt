Arthur Penn was an American stage director, television producer, and filmmaker. While serving in the army, Penn became interested in theatre and directed plays for his fellow soldiers. During the 1950s, Penn’s successful run as a director of television dramas for a variety of series led to an offer to direct the feature film The Left Handed Gun (1958) starring Paul Newman. Throughout the 1960s, Penn alternated between film and stage work, directing some of Hollywood’s biggest stars. During this period, Penn received three Academy Award nominations for The Miracle Worker (1962), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and Alice’s Restaurant (1969). The Miracle Worker was a film version of Penn’s Tony Award-winning Broadway production. Following this success, Penn became heavily influenced by the French New Wave and created films that captured the decade’s unrest by pushing boundaries applied to cinematic sex and violence. Though controversial, Bonnie and Clyde and Alice’s Restaurant were both critical and box office successes. Penn’s next major film was the 1970 comedy western Little Big Man, starring Dustin Hoffman. Though this film did not sustain the level of critical and commercial acclaim attained by his former films, Penn spent the next three decades alternating between narrative films and documentary segments. In the early 2000s, he returned to his theatre and television roots by directing successful stage productions of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (2000) and Fortune’s Fool (2002), and by serving as Executive Producer for the television series Law & Order (2000-2001).
