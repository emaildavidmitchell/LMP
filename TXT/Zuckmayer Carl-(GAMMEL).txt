Zuckmayer, Carl (1896-1977)

A veteran of World War I, German playwright Carl Zuckmayer delivered one of Germany’s most famous satires in his 1931 play Der Hauptmann von Köpenick (Captain of  Köpenick). The play recounts the story of real-life German folk hero Wilhelm Voigt (1849-1922; http://bit.ly/KuvSY6), an ex-convict who, in 1906, masqueraded as a Prussian officer, commandeering several groups of soldiers and grenadiers to march to city hall in Köpenick near Berlin in order to get his papers regularized. Ridiculing Wilhelmine Germany’s blind obedience to the military, the play was adapted in popular movies (1931 with Max Adalbert; 1956 with Heinz Rühmann).  In another social satire Zuckmayer collaborated with Karl Gustav Vollmöller on the script for the film Der blaue Engel (1930, directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Marlene Dietrich), adapting Heinrich Mann’s novel Professor Unrat, the story of an authoritarian teacher who comes under the spell of cabaret entertainer Lola Fröhlich. Culminating in one of Germany’s most successful post-war dramas, The Devil’s General (Des Teufels General, 1946) was modeled on his friend Ernst Udet (1896-1941), a brilliant aviator who commits suicide to escape complicity with the Nazi regime. Exiled during the Nazi era, Zuckmayer adopted American (1943) and eventually Swiss (1966) citizenships.
