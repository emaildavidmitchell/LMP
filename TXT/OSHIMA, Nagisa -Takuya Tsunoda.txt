OSHIMA, Nagisa (March 31, 1932 â€“ January 15, 2013)



Oshima Nagisa is often regarded as the most significant filmmaker after Kurosawa Akira in postwar Japan. Born in Okayama, Oshima attended the University of Kyoto, where he studied political science in the Department of Law. Hired by the Shochiku studio in 1954, Oshima quickly became the leading figure of the "Shochiku Nouvelle Vague" with his directorial debut feature Ai to kibo no machi (A Town of Love and Hope, 1959), Seishun zankoku monogatari (Cruel Story of Youth, 1960) and subsequent films that revolved around young and frustrated protagonists. However, he exited Shochiku in 1961 (after the release of his 1960 film Nihon no yoru to kiri [Night and Fog in Japan]) to establish his own production company Sozosha. There he pursued further politically and socially engaged projects, while simultaneously working on television documentaries (both to reach a larger audience and to secure a financial basis). Oshima was also a widely recognized public intellectual, overtly criticizing the postwar victim consciousness that obscured the question of war responsibility. His later films continued to challenge social taboos, including the issue of Korean residents and other minorities in Japan in Koshikei (Death by Hanging, 1968), Shonen (Boy, 1969) and numerous other documentaries, state-based violence over the oppressed in Tokyo senso sengo hiwa (Man Who Left His Will on Film, 1970) as well as the limit of political and sexual censorship in Ai no Korida (In the Realm of the Senses, 1976).
