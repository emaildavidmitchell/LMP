Obstfelder, Sigbjrn (1866-1900)

Sigbjrn Obstfelder is considered the first Norwegian modernist writer. He
wrote poetry, dramas and novels but is primarily known for his collection
of poems, Digte (1893, Poems). He was inspired by Charles Baudelaire and
French Symbolism, and experimented with prose poetry and with the musical
quality of language. His works are characterised by a tension between
contrasting themes, such as togetherness and solitude, inebriation and
anxiety. He had a tormented life with an unstable mental health and died of
tuberculosis in Copenhagen at the age of 34.

Born in Stavanger into a large family of modest means, Obstfelder received
a rather strict religious upbringing. In the 1880s he became interested in
the bohemian movement in Oslo, called Kristiania-Bohemen, though he never
completely shared its members life style, which openly challenged the
norms of bourgeoisie society. In 1890 he moved to the USA but, after a
rather disappointing stay, he travelled back to Norway already in 1891. In
the same year he suffered a breakdown and entered a mental asylum, where he
stayed for a few months. His restlessness drove him to travel extensively
around Europe, visiting European capitals such as Paris, Brussels and
Copenhagen.

In 1892 Obstfelder was encouraged to pursue his literary career by the
Norwegian author Vilhelm Krag. Obstfelders works are typical examples of
fin de sicle literature of the 1890s. His works are characterised by a
feeling of anxiety, solitude and alienation as well as by an interest in
new experimental forms. He is mainly known for his poetry, in which he
abandoned rhymed verse in favour of free verse and created new connections
between the written word and sound. All these aspects can be found in his
first collection of poems, Poems    which was directly inspired by
Baudelaires prose poems Petit pomes  and, in particular, in his most
iconic poem Jeg ser. Obstfelders works were praised by the Danish
Symbolists, gathering around the Danish author Johannes Jrgensen and the
journal Taarnet (1893-1895).

Although he continued to publish poetry in journals and newspapers, after
his debut collection Obstfelder started to experiment with other genres.
His novel Korset (1896) became his most successful work economically. His
En prests dagbog (1900, A Priests Diary), where the narrator takes up
religious issues and tries to respond to the challenges of his contemporary
society, was only published posthumously. Obstfelder also produced three
dramas, De rde drabber (1897), Esther (1899) and Om vren (1902), which
was performed at the National Theatre in Oslo in 1902.
