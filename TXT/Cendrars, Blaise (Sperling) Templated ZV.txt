     Blaise Cendrars (born Frédéric-Louis Sauser) was a Franco-Swiss poet, novelist, journalist, filmmaker and explorer. Though his career spanned many decades, Cendrars is now best known for his involvement in the Parisian avant-garde just prior to and following World War I. After the war he wrote La Fin du monde filmée par l'Ange Notre-Dame (1919), the first poem to assume the form of a screenplay. He collaborated with Abel Gance on La Roue (1923), and proceeded to author the foundational essay L’ABC du Cinema (1926). In it, he proposes that “a new humanity, and that a breed of new men will appear. Their language will be cinema.” Cendrars’ combination of media theory and progressive sociology anticipate the theories of Marshall McLuhan. Cendrars later penned Hollywood, La Mecque du cinema (1936) for the French press, in which he dispels the utopian conceptions of American entertainment industry, instead highlighting the culture of spectacle inherent in 1930s Hollywood.
