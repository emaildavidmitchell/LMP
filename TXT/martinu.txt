Bohuslav Martinů 

Thomas Svatos 

Bohuslav Martinů (1890-1959).  Czech composer of Austro-Hungarian, Czechoslovak, and then American citizenship.  He left his native Polička in Eastern Bohemia for Prague in 1906 for violin studies at the Prague Conservatory.  Although expelled for negligence, he continued residing in the Czech capital until 1923, playing as a deputy violinist with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra from 1913 and then as a full member under Václav Talich (1920-23).  Although largely self-taught in composition, he studied with Josef Suk in Prague (1922-23) and Albert Roussel from the time his arrival in Paris in 1923; he made Paris his residence until 1940.  In Spring, 1941, he arrived in New York City, where he quickly emerged as a prominent composer.  Injuries from a severe accident in 1946 and the communist coup in Czechoslovakia in 1948 discouraged his plans to continue work in Prague.  With no reversal in the communist regime’s hostile stance towards him, he took American citizenship in 1952.  His one-year fellowship at the American Academy in Rome formed the pretext for him to resettle in Europe in 1956.  The Paul Sacher Estate in Switzerland became his final residence; he died in nearby Liestal in 1959.

His first major performance was in Prague in 1919 with his neo-romantic, patriotic cantata Czech Rhapsody (1918).  Composed in the atmosphere of Czechoslovakia’s independence, it was an exception stylistically among works from his early years, when first Mozart and then Debussy exerted the greatest influence on him.  He came under the spell of Stravinsky after his arrival in Paris, leading to rhythmically oriented, “dynamistic” works such as his “orchestral-rondo” Half-time (1924) and his String Quartet No. 2 (1925).  In the later 1920s, jazz and pastiche emerge in works that include his entertaining ballet Kitchen Revue (1927).

These influences disappear by the 1930s, when he embraced an austere, neo-classical idiom; his polyphonically mannered Piano Trio: Five Short Pieces (1930) was a decisive work in this stylistic shift.  The eighteenth-century concerto grosso influenced his orchestral works resulting in his Inventions (1934), Concerto Grosso (1937), Tre Ricercari (1938), and Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano, and Timpani (1938).  During the 1930s, he also undertook an ambitious project for the Czech Theater, where he mined pre-romantic, Czech folk sources for works embracing anti-Wagnerian principles; products include his “singing-ballet” Špalíček (1932) and his operatic cycle of medieval mystery stories The Plays of Mary (1934).  His surrealist opera Julietta, or the Key to Dreams (1937) formed the culmination of his work for the Czech stage; it was premiered under Talich at the Prague National Theater in March, 1938.

Patronage by top musical personalities in the U.S. such as conductor Serge Koussevitsky led him to embrace the symphony, resulting in his Symphonies Nos. 1-5 (1942-46).  Under the influence of renaissance polyphonic genres, he appropriated ametrical phrasing, as heard in the first movement of his Symphony No. 1 (1942).  Another new element from this time includes a cadential progression borrowed from his opera Julietta, which he deployed in numerous works throughout the rest of his life; the progression, often called the “Julietta Chords,” is a kind of plagal cadence from a dominant 13th chord on the subdominant to the tonic, which he often repeats immediately thereafter a whole-tone lower.  Masterful chamber works from his early American years include his Piano Quartet (1942), Madrigal Sonata (1943), and Trio for Flute, Cello, and Piano (1944).  By the end of his American residence, he had taught composition at Tanglewood, Mannes, Princeton, and Curtis.  His near-fatal fall from an unprotected terrace during the summer of 1946 while on staff at the Berkshire Music Festival resulted in partial deafness in one ear for the rest of his life.

During the 1950s, he developed a more rhapsodic, neo-impressionistic idiom; notable works featuring an expanded orchestral palette and greater focus on instrumental textures include his Fantaisies Symphoniques, “Symphony No. 6” (1953), Piano Concerto No. 4 “Incantation” (1956), and Estampes (1958).  Soon after its publication in Czechoslovakia in 1956, his folk cantata Opening of the Wells (1955) was performed in schools throughout the country, leading to his revival and widespread acceptance throughout the Czech musical community.  Work on his opera The Greek Passion, which resulted in two different versions (1957, 1959), formed the thread of his creative activity throughout his final peripatetic years.

A champion of musical craft, he believed in the organic principles of Gestalt guiding the composer in the act of musical creation.  Becoming his axiom was an insistence that the work speak alone rather than having it to serve a social or political cause.  Provoking confusion and misunderstanding among critics and historians was his emotionless exterior and reticence in public situations; he has been diagnosed posthumously as having suffered from a form of Asperger Syndrome, offering an explanation to his savant-like abilities for composition that made him one of the most productive composers of the century.  His harmonic language remained triadically based throughout his life and embracing atonality or artificial systems was never an issue for him; instead he saw new solutions to form and content, phrasing, and synthesis among his greatest contributions.
