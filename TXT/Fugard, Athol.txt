Athol Fugard[i] (June 11, 1932 - ?[ii]) has been a novelist and
memoirist[iii] (of sorts), but is best known for his pioneering
political[iv] work in the theater. In the theater, he has been writer,
director, and actor[v], and often all three at once, as in the case of his
Blood Knot[vi] (1961, 1987), where extensive revisions to his original
script emerged from his work as one of the plays leads. A South
African[vii] by birth, Fugard focused many of his most famous works on the
meanings and consequences[viii] of Apartheid. These political explorations
owe a debt to Bertolt Brecht[ix] in both form and desired effect.
      Fugards very Brechtian modernism returns its focus again and again
to performance (often race as performance) and language (particularly the
material nature of language). Characters in his plays frequently become
playactors themselves, with their stacked performances aimed at opening a
Brechtian rift (or eliciting a modernist shock) that forces audience
interrogation[x] of the very ideas of reality and performance. The Island
(1972; co-written) features two political prisoners performing Antigone and
debating whether costumes[xi] work to entrance or estrange. Even Master
Haroldand the boys[xii] (1982)a largely autobiographical workexamines
the shifting dance of personal, professional, and power relationships
alongside the preparation of a performance for a dance contest[xiii]. Blood
Knot premiered the same year as Samuel Becketts Happy Days[xiv] and, like
that play, makes a performance of daily life, utilizing the same intrusive
ringing (here physically represented as an alarm clock) to structure and
cue movement, moments or scenes of the day, and the beginnings and ends of
playacting and elaborate fantasy. The character Morris specifically cites
whiteness as a performance rooted in more than the mere costume of white
skin:

            Look, Zach, what Im trying to say is this. The clothes will
help, but only
           help. They dont maketh the white man. Its that white something
           inside you, that special meaning and manner of whiteness. I know
           what Im talking about because  Ill be honest with you now,
           Zach  Ive thought about it for a long time. And the first
           fruit of my thought, Zach, is that this whiteness of theirs is
           not just in the skin, otherwise  well, I mean  Id be one of
           them, wouldnt I? Because, let me tell you, Zach, I seen them
           thats darker than me. (103)

The play itself centers on Zachariahs linguistic performance of whiteness
through letters[xv] he exchanges with a white woman. But this leads to a
confrontation between Zach and his brother Morris about their radically
different skin tones and what performances are available only to the light-
skinned Morris.
      It is perhaps this play that most closely ties Fugards Brechtian
attention to performance to the attention to language more frequently
associated with modernist prose and poetry. Critics like Dennis Walder draw
attention to Fugards modernist theatrical language: Words are only part
of what Fugard definesin terms borrowed from Ezra Poundas his crucial
image: the presentation of a psychological and emotional complex in a
moment of time. Movement, gesture, the sub-textual penumbra of dialogue:
all contribute to a theatrical language often most eloquent when it is
silent (ix-x). But we would be selling Fugard short to ignore his specific
attention to language itself. Blood Knot explores languages role as
vehicle of performance but also as material object capable of expressing
physically as much as symbolically:

            Zachariah: Ja. They call a man a boy. You got a word for that,
Morris?
            Morris: Long or short?
            Zachariah: Squashed, like it didnt fit the mouth.
            Morris: I know the one you mean.
            Zachariah: Ja, then say it.
            Morris: Prejudice.
            Zachariah: Pre-ja-dis.
            Morris: Injustice!
            Zachariah: Thats all out of shape as well. (74)
