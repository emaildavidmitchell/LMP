To Ngoc Van (1906-1954)

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

To Ngoc Van was a notable Vietnamese painter, and one of the first generation of students to graduate from the École des Beaux Arts de l’Indochine, Hanoi, founded in 1925. He was known primarily for his works in oil, which captured the romantic subjects popular in Vietnamese painting of the 1930s and 1940s. As one of the first Vietnamese artists to write and publish art criticism in the local press, he was also influential in shaping the public discourse around Vietnamese modern art. Like many other intellectuals of his generation, he lived through the transition from the colonial period to the anti-colonial, Communist-led revolution, and consequently had to make profound changes to his ideas and practices. During the First Indochina War (1946-1954), he transformed his manner of painting to suit the new ideological environment, creating propaganda works to boost morale, as well as images of peasants and soldiers. However, he was still a strong advocate for the visual arts, and published passionate defenses of creative freedom, artistic education and the practice of modern Vietnamese lacquer painting, despite the ideological pressures of the period.

To Ngoc Van was born in Hanoi. From 1926-1931, he studied at the École des Beaux Arts de l’Indochine (EBAI). To Ngoc Van worked in several media, but became best known for his oil paintings, which were typical of the romantic tone of work from the EBAI. His paintings showed some Post-Impressionistic influences in the flattening of the compositional space, although he generally favoured gentle and harmonious colours.

In 1945, To Ngoc Van joined the Viet Minh anti-colonial uprising. When war broke out in 1946, he moved to the resistance zone in North Vietnam. That year, he was also one of the earliest artists commissioned to create a portrait of Ho Chi Minh. His artwork changed during wartime (1946-1954) to reflect the requirements of the Viet Minh’s cultural guidelines, using a more realist style and taking soldiers and peasants as his subjects. His artworks from wartime were predominantly drawings, as material conditions prevented the production of major works. From 1950-1953, To Ngoc Van served as the director of the first post-colonial art school in Vietnam, commonly referred to as the Khoa Khang Chien [Resistance Class]. This class studied drawing, painting and printmaking in the difficult conditions of the resistance zones, moving between locations to avoid bombings, sharing their work with the local population in makeshift exhibitions. In April 1954, To Ngoc Van was sent to the battle of Dien Bien Phu to sketch the activities of the military, before his untimely death in June of that year.



To Ngoc Van also had an important role in developing the public discourse around Vietnamese art. In the colonial period, he wrote for a number of important cultural newspapers, reflecting on the progress of the fledgling Vietnamese modern arts. In his articles written after 1945, he advanced ideas that were controversial in the ideological environment of the revolution: for example, he argued strongly for the distinction between artistic creation and ideological propaganda, and for promoting the importance of education in the arts to create informed criticism. He also championed Vietnamese lacquer painting, which he thought could make an important contribution to global modernism. In his own resistance-period work, he experimented with creating lacquer paintings on revolutionary subjects. Although his writings were criticised in this period, To Ngoc Van was nonetheless revered as a revolutionary hero after his death.
