Mart Stam

Mart (Martinus Adrianus) Stam (1899 in Purmerend, Netherlands  1986 in
Goldach, Switzerland) was a Dutch architect, designer, and architectural
theorist and was involved in a number of principal events and organisations
during the 1920s and 1930s.

Stam moved to Berlin in 1922 to work as a draughtsman with Max Taut and
Hans Poelzig among others. While in Berlin, Stam met El Lissitzky who
introduced him to constructivism. Inspired by the progressive and social
outlook of this Russian movement Stam founded the avant-garde magazine ABC.
Beitrge zum Neuen Bauen [ABC. Contributions on Building] together with
Hans Schmidt and Emil Roth (1924-1928). The magazine focussed on convincing
readers about the social necessity for low-cost, well-designed, and
functional houses as well as the use of modern technologies. ABC
furthermore established connections to Asnova the association of new
architects in Moscow, and published student work of Vkhutemas [School of
Modern Architecture] in Moscow.

In 1927 Stam contributed to the exhibition Die Wohnung [The Dwelling] in
Stuttgart with the design of a row house [Fig. 1]. The exhibition was
organized by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and the Deutsche Werkbund to showcase
developments of functionalist and objective architecture and was
influential in the dissemination of ideas about modern design and
architecture. In his design, Stam was interested in the development of mass-
housing types for working-class dwellers.

For his house in Stuttgart, Stam also designed a cantilevered tubular steel
chair  his best-known design [Fig. 2]. The novelty of the chair was in the
idea of a seat without back legs for support. As a proponent of
functionalism Stam sought to overcome predetermined designs and shapes and
rejected notions of beauty through symmetry, or the use of ornament for
symbolic and representational ends. Designers like Stam developed objects
by analysing their use andby incorporating mass-producible materials to
arrive at a prototype for mass-production, instead of at a handcrafted and
unique item.

In 1928 Stam was among the founding members of the CIAM (Congrs
internationaux d'architecture moderne) that provided an international
platform for the various members and theoretical outlooks of the early 20th-
century modern movement.

In 1928/29, Stam taught as a guest lecturer for urban planning at the
Bauhaus in Dessau and also began working at Frankfurt am Main. Here, the
German architect Ernst May pursued under the title Das Neue Frankfurt [The
New Frankfurt] a citywide housing programme for working-class dwellers in
an effort to establish better living conditions through standardised
housing types. Stam was involved in the settlement Hellerhof (1929) [Fig.
3] and the Henry and Emma Budge Foundation Old Peoples Home (1929-1930).
He furthermore joined May when he was invited to the USSR to work on city
planning and standard designs for housing and communal living. (1930)
[Fig. 4].

Stams most acclaimed work during the 1930s is the Drive-in Flats (1936) in
Amsterdam. For five years after World War II Stam taught at several
institutions in the German Democratic Republic (1948-1953) but he did not
regain his pre-war influence in later years.
