Although his career spanned many decades, Cendrars is now best known for his involvement in the Parisian avant-garde just prior to and following World War I. After the war he wrote La Fin du monde filmée par l'Ange Notre-Dame (1919), the first poem to assume the form of a screenplay. As with many other French modernists, Cendrars was an early cinephile. He collaborated with Abel Gance on La Roue (1923) and his essay L’ABC du Cinema (1926) adopted a rapturous, millenarian tone in relation to the new medium. In its combination of media theory and messianic sociology, Cendrars’s ideas anticipated the theories of Marshall McLuhan. In the 1930s, Cendrars travelled to Hollywood to report on the American dream-factory for the French press. His dispatches, collected in Hollywood: Mecca of the Movies, betrayed a less utopian, more sardonic appraisal of the American entertainment industry and its attendant culture of spectacle and fame.
