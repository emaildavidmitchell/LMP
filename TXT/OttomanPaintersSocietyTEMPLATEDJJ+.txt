|Established in 1909, the Society of Ottoman Artists [Osmanl         |
|Ressamlar Cemiyeti] was the first professional organisation of       |
|artists in the Ottoman Empire. Initiated by the artist Mehmet Ruhi   |
|Arel and financed by Prince Abdlmecid, it aimed to integrate        |
|artistic production and consumption into the modern society          |
|envisioned after the Second Constitutional Revolution. By including  |
|practitioners of traditional book arts in addition to artists working|
|in Western modes of painting and sculpture, it reflected an          |
|integrated vision of modern local cultural production. It            |
|disseminated technical and historical information about the arts in  |
|the Ottoman and European traditions through its Journal of the       |
|Society of Ottoman Artists. After its dissolution in 1919 due to the |
|instability of the Ottoman Empire, similar organisations were        |
|established including the Society of Turkish Painters [Trk Ressamlar|
|Cemiyeti] (1921), the Union of Turkish Fine Arts [Trk Sanayii Nefise|
|Birlii] (1926), and the Gzel Sanatlar Birlii (1929). Following    |
|nearly a century of reforms, which implemented a mode of             |
|modernisation modelled after Europe, the Second Constitutional       |
|Revolution of 1909 realised a long-standing dream among many         |
|progressives to establish a constitutional monarchy. It followed the |
|long reign of Sultan Abdlhamid II (1876-1909), who had used the war |
|with Russia in 1877 to foil the first constitutional revolution,     |
|following his ascension to power after a coup against Sultan         |
|Abdulaziz the previous year.                                         |

|Despite great strides in the dissemination of bureaucratic,          |
|educational, technological, and urban education, Sultan Abdlhamid   |
|advocated social conservatism that emphasised his credentials as     |
|Caliph of the Islamic world and protector of Muslims inside and      |
|outside of the shrinking Ottoman Empire. Increasingly concerned about|
|the possibilities of an assassination attempt or coup such as that   |
|which initiated his own reign, the ten years preceding his deposition|
|were fraught with censorship restricting cultural production. Thus   |
|the Second Constitutional Revolution, led by the Committee of Union  |
|and Progress, which promoted equal citizenship, growth in civil      |
|society, and advocated for Westernised cultural values, initially    |
|held great promise for many progressive citizens of the Ottoman      |
|Empire.                                                              |

|The idea to create a professional forum and legal protection for fine|
|artists began with Mehmed Ruhi (Arel; 1880-1931), a graduate of the  |
|Naval Academy who informally assembled his friends in the ehzadeba|
|district of Istanbul in 1909. Mehmed Sami (Yetik; 1878-1935), evket |
|(Da; 1876-1948), Hikmet (Onat; 1882-1977), brahim (all;          |
|1882-1960), Ali Rza (1858-1939), Ahmed Ziya, erif Abdlkadirzade   |
|Hseyin Haim, Ahmed zzet, Mehmed Muazzez, Mahmud, and zzet Mesmur |
|attended these meetings. Some of the initial members were recent     |
|graduates of the academy, while others were art teachers. Although   |
|the organisation was initially founded among friends, it became      |
|economically viable only under the patronage of Prince Abdlmecid    |
|(1868-1944), who spent his life before the revolution under luxurious|
|house arrest after the deposition of his father in 1876. More artists|
|joined, including Osman Asaf, Darsafakal Galip, mer Adil         |
|(1868-1928), Nazmi Ziya (Gran; 1881-1937), Hseyin Avni, Mehmed Ali,|
|Feyhaman (Duran; 1886-1970), Hasan Vecih (Bereketolu; 1895-1971),   |
|Namk smail (1890-1935), skdarl Cevat (Gktengiz; 1871-1939),    |
|Celal Esad (Arseven; 1876-1971), Mithat Rebii, and the women artists |
|Mihri Rasim/Mfik (1886-1956) and Mfide Kadri (1890-1912). Artists |
|came from varying educational backgrounds, and all forms of art were |
|within the range of interest of the organisation, which included a   |
|sculptor and a calligrapher. While practitioners of traditional arts |
|were not members of the organisation, the Journal of the Society of  |
|Ottoman Artists (Osmanl Ressamlar Cemiyeti Gazetesi)  included      |
|articles on calligraphy and illumination. Although many of its       |
|members went to Paris for their education soon after its foundation, |
|they continued to participate in debates about the nature and role of|
|art back home, and also sent letters and sketches from Paris.        |
|                                                                     |
|The journal published eighteen issues between 1911 and 1914. Its     |
|frst issue expressed four aims: to serve as a forum among artists to|
|discuss the role of art in society; to provide information about the |
|history and techniques of art; to provide monographic information    |
|about important Ottoman artists; and to advertise the Society of     |
|Ottoman Artists centre, which included the first permanent           |
|sales-oriented gallery in the empire. Edited by erif Abdlkadirzade |
|Hseyin Haim, the journal featured articles on art history, the     |
|philosophy of art, art technique, and monographs on Turkish and      |
|European artists. It also included technical discussions of          |
|perspectival construction and of oil paint and colour. In contrast to|
|most Western critical discourse, the journal was more interested in  |
|the role of art, the artist in society, and the technical aspects of |
|art rather than in arts communicative function  a mode of          |
|sociological rather than analytical treatment or criticism.          |
|                                                                     |
|An elaborate masthead illustrated the journals objectives. The front|
|page of each issue featured a complex emblem with two brushes of     |
|different shapes tied with a large ribbon hanging through the        |
|thumbhole of a palette daubed with paints in front of several tools  |
|of the trade  a compass, a tube of paint, etching tools. Following  |
|this was a scene framed by a crescent moon, showing a desk with a    |
|portrait bust of Prince Abdlmecid wearing a suit and fez. To the    |
|side, a mechanical pencil holder and the end of a laurel branch hold |
|open a scroll bearing the organisations name. A second laurel branch|
|unites the composition, framing it as a single medallion pierced by a|
|maulstick. Through this emblem, the journal presents itself as an    |
|agent of professionalisation, promising to give meaning to the       |
|technical aspects of art making while promoting an organic and       |
|progressive conjunction of Western and Ottoman traditions.           |
|                                                                     |
|The connection of the paper with the notion of progress implied      |
|affiliation with the Committee for Union and Progress. The repeated  |
|emphasis on copying from nature in discussions of aesthetics         |
|strengthened this association with scientific endeavour. As was the  |
|case for public art institutions of the late empire, this private    |
|institutionalisation of art, while conservative in its artistic      |
|approaches, incorporated social utilitarianism and political         |
|radicalism.                                                          |
