Pret, Benjamin (1899-1959)

Benjamin Pret was a French surrealist poet whose expansive body of work
exemplifies the surrealist commitment to adventure, sacrilege, and
irrational, marvelous imagery. Born at the turn of the century in Rez,
Pret participated in Paris Dada before joining the surrealist movement. He
authored over thirty volumes of poetry, essays, and fiction, and co-edited
the first three issues of the journal La Rvolution surraliste, the
movements mouthpiece during its founding years. Pret spent years in
Brazil and Mexico, contributing to the global reach of French
surrealismand drawing inspiration from South American mythology; his
publications include an anthology of Mexican folklore and the translation
from Spanish of a Mayan epic. Politically radical, Pret fought in the
Spanish Civil War, but opposed the harnessing of poetry to any particular
political cause. In his 1945 polemic against World War II Resistance
poetry, The Poets Dishonour, Pret called for the liberation of poetry
from religious and patriotic dogma, insisting that the poets task is to be
a "permanent revolutionary."
