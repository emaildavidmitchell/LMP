von Heidenstam, (Carl Gustaf) Verner (1859-1940)

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

Verner von Heidenstam was a Swedish poet and prosaist whose name is closely associated with modern Swedish nationalism. He is counted among the most influential advocates of the conservative movement throughout early Swedish modernism and was also attacked by Strindberg during the famous Strindberg Feud. The national romantic tendencies in his literary works, as well as their idealistic historicism, stand in sharp contrast to the realistic, socio-critical slogans of the 1880s. As of 1912, Heidenstam was a member of the Swedish Academy, and in 1916 he received the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 1910 he acquired the manor Övralid in the south of Sweden where he died in 1940.

He is counted among the most influential advocates of the conservative movement throughout early Swedish modernism and was also attacked by Strindberg during the famous Strindberg Feud. The national romantic tendencies in his literary works, as well as their idealistic historicism, stand in sharp contrast to the realistic, socio-critical slogans of the 1880s.

In 1910 he acquired the manor Övralid in the south of Sweden where he died in 1940.



Verner von Heidenstam was the son of a wealthy, aristocratic family from the county of Örebro. In 1888 he debuted his first collection of poems, Vallfart och vandringsår, inspired by his early educational journeys to the Middle East. The poems convey a characteristic touch of oriental exoticism and an enjoyment of life which breaks with the socio-critical realism of the 1880s. The same can be said of his first novel, Endymion, where the ‘Decline of the East’ motif is developed. In his second novel, Hans Alienus, verse and prose are intermixed and the praise of hedonism is evident. Heidenstam’s intense engagement with Swedish cultural history and heritage is reflected in some of his most popular works: Karolinerna (The Charles Men) is a series of historical sketches about King Charles XII, the two volumes of Folkungaträdet (The Tree of the Folkungs) tell the tales of medieval Swedish clans and chieftains, and Svenskarna och deras hövdingar (The Swedes and Their Chieftains) was published as a history book for young students. Moreover, Heidenstam wrote several polemic pamphlets and his Renässans-manifesto from 1889 had considerable influence on the aesthetic debate of his time.



Verner von Heidenstam was married three times: first to Emilia Uggla, then to Olga (Mathilda) Wiberg, and thirdly, to Greta (Anna Margareta) Sjöberg. From 1916 until his death he lived with Kate Bang. After 1915 Heidenstam basically ceased writing poetry. He was severely criticized for his pro-German attitude during the 1930s.
