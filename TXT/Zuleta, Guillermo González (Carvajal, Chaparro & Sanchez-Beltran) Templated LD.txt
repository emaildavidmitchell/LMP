González Zuleta, Guillermo (c. 1916-1995)

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

A structural engineer and designer, González Zuleta was engaged in pioneering architectural and engineering works in Colombia over a period of more than fifty years. His interest in exploring new forms and techniques was a keystone in the development of concrete works of infrastructure nationwide. Having begun his studies in industrial engineering at the Universidad Nacional de Chile, two years later he returned to Bogotá where he went on to achieve a Bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (1940); in 1986 the same university conferred on him a doctorate honoris causa.



Guillermo González Zuleta was a son of the engineer Fabio González Taver, winner of the Ponce de Leon award and a scholar of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, and a grandson of Juan Nepomuceno González Vasquez, an engineer who studied at the École Centrale du Paris and who was known for having built a bridge across the Tiber (Rome). He went on to design the first railroads in Colombia, and was also a founder partner of the Colombian Society of Engineers. González Zuleta thus continued a family tradition.

During the 1940s and 1950s González Zuleta worked in the public sector, as director of Public Works in Ibague and later as principal of the department of [structural] calculation of the Ministry of Public Works, and also as deputy director of National Buildings. As a scholar, he was a professor of architecture and engineering at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and Universidad de los Andes. In his private practice, Gonzales Zuleta was involved in works nationwide, designing, consulting on, and building such structures as stadiums, coliseums, churches, transport stations, water treatment plants, and monasteries.



During his professional career, he promoted the integration between architecture and engineering, and challenged traditional structures. He was a pioneer in the early 1940s in the development of concrete shells, hyperbolic paraboloids, sequenced vaults, and the use of preforce concrete.



Gonzales Zuleta received the national award of engineering three times: in 1947 for the baseball stadium in Cartagena; in 1967 for the structural design of Manaure harbour; and in 1974 for the El Campín Coliseum in Bogotá. In 1991, the Society of Colombian Architects honoured him with the ‘José Gómez Pinzón’ lifetime achievement award.
