Duncan, Robert (Edward) (1919-1988)

Robert Duncan was an American poet, dramatist, and critic central to the
SAN FRANCISCO RENAISSANCE and BLACK MOUNTAIN COLLEGE. He was born Edward
Howard Duncan Jr., renamed Robert Edward Symmes by his THEOSOPHIST adoptive
parents. He published as Robert Symmes in his early works and finally
combined his names to form Robert Duncan in 1941 after his military
discharge. After seven years in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New York,
Duncan returned to California in 1945 and remained in the Bay Area until
his death in 1988 of kidney disease.
      Duncan first began writing poetry seriously during his undergraduate
studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and he became connected
to international literary networks after joining James Cooneys commune in
Woodstock, New York, where he worked on the journal The Phoenix. HENRY
MILLER and LAWRENCE DURRELL were both contributors to the journal, and
Duncan published both as well as ANAIS NIN in his own Experimental Review.
He took part in a failed American publication of Millers Tropic of Cancer
(1934) and attempted to publish two post-Surrealist books by Durrell.
Duncan was by this time identifying with ANARCHISM. In 1941 he declared his
homosexuality and was discharged from the military. He married two years
later, but this failed quickly, and he published his seminal essay The
Homosexual in Society in Politics in 1944 after returning to San
Francisco. As a consequence, John Crowe Ransom rejected Duncans Toward an
African Elegy for Kenyon Review and the work was later published in Circle
in 1948, a journal closely affiliated with Miller that had already
published his The Years as Catches (1946). Bern Porter, co-editor of
Circle, published Duncans first poetry collection Heavenly City, Earthly
City (1947). Across his career, Duncan engaged deeply with modernist
poetics, particularly the work of H.D. and EZRA POUND, but like the British
NEW APOCALYPSE he included Romantic interests in the irrational and
organic. Anarchism and the occult were also deep influences. His work is
most closely associated with his contemporaries KENNETH REXROTH, CHARLES
OLSON, JACK SPICER, ROBIN BLASER, and ROBERT CREELEY. In 1951, Duncan met
the artist JESS COLLINS who was his partner until his death.
      In the 1960s, Duncans most successful works appeared: The Opening of
the Field (1960), Roots and Branches (1964), and Bending the Bow (1968). In
these, his modernist interests are most overt, as are his anarchist
refutations of the Vietnam War and formal and stylistic innovation. Shortly
thereafter, Duncans break with the poet DENISE LEVERTOV expressed his
changing views on poetry and its social uses, and his large project The
H.D. Book (2011) grew across the 1970s. This book and the Levertov
correspondence comprise the most important exposition of his poetics in
prose. Duncan did not publish books of poetry again until Ground Work I:
Before the War (1984), which won the national Poetry Award in 1985, and
Ground Work II: In the Dark (1987), immediately prior to this death. The
University of California Press published Duncans collected works between
2011 and 2014.
