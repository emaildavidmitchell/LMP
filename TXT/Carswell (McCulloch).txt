Carswell, Catherine (1879-1946)

Catherine Carswell  was one of an increasing number of women who tested
boundaries in life and literature in the early years of the twentieth
century. Born Catherine Macfarlane in Glasgow, she made legal history in
1908 when her first marriage was annulled on the grounds of her husbands
mental incapacity. She supported her daughter of the marriage by
journalism, writing fiction reviews for the Glasgow Herald and drama
criticism for the Observer and was dismissed by the Glasgow Herald for
publishing her review of D. H. LAWRENCEs The Rainbow without previous
editorial consent. Her compensation was a friendship and correspondence
with LAWRENCE which lasted until his death. She published two novels, Open
the Door which was copiously critiqued by LAWRENCE and won the Melrose
prize for fiction in 1920; and The Camomile published in 1922. Her
biography of Robert Burns (1930) outraged the Scottish Burns Clubs by its
treatment of Burns as a sexual being, and her memoir of LAWRENCE, The
Savage Pilgrimage (1934) was written in refutation of JOHN MIDDLETON
MURRYs Son of Woman. Her work made a significant contribution to modern
Scottish literature.
