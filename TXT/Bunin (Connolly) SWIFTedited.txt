BUNIN, Ivan Akekseevich (,  ) (1870-1973)

The first Russian writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature
(1933), Bunin was best known as a master of the Russian short story who
carried the classical traditions of Russian literature into the twentieth
century.  Born in a provincial capital southeast of Moscow, Bunin began his
literary career as a poet, and his early prose stories and sketches reflect
his lyrical orientation.  After travelling to the Middle East in the first
decade of the twentieth century, Bunin gained a heightened sense of
historical cyclesthe rise and fall of civilizations and empiresand he
incorporated his perceptions in major new works on the decline of Russian
country life such as The Village (Derevnia) (1910) and Dry Valley
(Sukhodol) (1912).  His work gained further philosophical depth through his
interest in Buddhism and his travels to Southeast Asia.  Bunin reacted with
dismay to the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and the Russian Revolution in
1917, and he left Russia in 1920, ultimately settling in France.  Over the
last decades of his life he created a series of exquisite short stories and
novellas depicting the haunting power of sudden but fleeting passion as
well as the impenetrable mysteries of life and death.

Ivan Alekseevich Bunin was born on October 10, 1870 (Old Style) in the
provincial town of Voronezh into a family of gentry landowners of modest
means.  Raised in the Russian countryside, Bunin began writing poetry at an
early age, and published his first poems and short stories in 1887.  He
achieved significant fame with a verse collection entitled Falling Leaves
(Listopad) in 1901 and with lyrical sketches about the decline of Russian
gentry life such as Antonov Apples (Antonovskie iabloki), which
features a Proustian emphasis on the senses as an aid to memory.  Traveling
to the Middle East in the first decade of the twentieth century, Bunin
gained new insight into the way that major civilizations of the past rose
and fell, and when he returned to Russia, he applied his insight to the
depiction of the transformation of Russian country life.  Two of his works,
The Village ( Derevnia) and Dry Valley (Sukhodol), drew particular
attention from critics and readers for their sober presentation of the
gradual degeneration of the Russian village and gentry estate.

Bunin also travelled to Southeast Asia in 1911, and his contact with
Buddhist culture and thought made a significant impact on the works he
wrote in the mid 1910s.  Several of his short stories, such as Brethren
(Bratia) (1914) and The Dreams of Chang (Sny Changa), offer pointed
commentary on the futility of desire and the evanescence of human life.  A
keen observer of literary developments around him, Bunin was disdainful of
many of the artistic innovations he saw in Modernist movements such as
SYMBOLISM and FUTURISM, and the outbreak of World War I confirmed his view
that modern society was headed for calamity.  It was in this spirit that he
wrote a short story that is one of his most well-known works in the West,
The Gentleman from San Francisco (Gospodin iz San-Frantsisko ) (1915),
which traces the grand tour of Europe undertaken by a rich American
businessman whose life is cut short by sudden death in Capri.  The story
provides a searing indictment of modern materialism.

The outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917 shook Bunin to the core.
First fleeing to Odessa in 1918 and then to France in 1920, Bunin recorded
his anxiety and shock at the changes he saw transpiring around him in a
work later published under the title Cursed Days (Okaiannye dni) (1936).
Once settled in France, however, Bunin returned to artistic literature and
wrote several short stories and novellas depicting the power of passion and
the enigma of the human soul.  His most significant work was a novel based
in part on his own childhood and youth, The Life of Arseniev (Zhizn
Arseneva) (1930).  His contributions to literature earned him the
distinction of becoming the first Russian writer to be awarded the Nobel
Prize in Literature in 1933.  Yet the satisfaction and financial stability
afforded him by this prize did not last.  With the onset of World War II,
Bunin was forced to live an austere existence in Grasse, in the south of
France.  Even during this difficult time, though, Bunin managed to write a
set of short stories that are among the finest of his career.  This
collection, entitled Dark Avenues (Temnye allei) (1943), contains
wonderfully concise and evocative depictions of the power and fragility of
love.  These were the last major works Bunin finished before his death in
1953.
