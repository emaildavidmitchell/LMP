SEMENKO, Mykhail' (Семенко, Михайль) (1892-1937)







Founder, theoretician and major poet of the Ukrainian futurist movement; editor of the journal, Nova generatsiia (NEW GENERATION, 1927-1930). He was executed during the Stalinist terror on trumped up charges of Ukrainian nationalism. A prolific poet, he began writing in the spirit of symbolism, but turned to futurism in 1914 with the collections Derzannia (Bravado) and Kvero-Futuryzm (Quaero-futurism, 1914), which created a major scandal. His 1924 collection, Kobzar, appropriated the title of Ukraine’s greatest romantic poet Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861), further alienating a conservative public. Semenko relished being the bad boy of Ukrainian poetry, offering a broad spectrum of innovative, sometimes shocking, verse, ranging from vers libre, to playful trans-sense lyrics to self-deprecating, prosaic love poems. He wrote visual poetry, dubbed “poetry-painting.”  Urban themes and satirical topical verse are a hallmark of his creativity. As a theoretician, he developed Panfuturism, defined in 1922 as being “at once Futurism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Dadaism—but… not simply a synthesis of these useful things” (Semafor u Maibutnie 1 (May 1922): 12). Influenced both by Italian and Russian futurism, Semenko rightly insisted on the originality and autonomy of his movement, which became a major force in transforming Ukrainian culture of the 1910s and 1920s.
