Claude Vivier (1948-1983) 

Paul Bazin



Perhaps the best known of all Quebec composers, both in Canada and abroad.  He first attended composer Gilles Tremblayâ€™s classes at the Montreal Conservatory of Music before travelling to Cologne (Germany) where he became a student of Karlheinz Stockhausen. Vivier is the author of a catalogue bearing many traces of an intense journey of self-discovery. An opera, Kopernikus (1979), as well as three orchestral art songs (Lonely Child, 1980; Wo bist du Licht, 1981; Bouchara, 1981) are among his most affecting works. His major work for strings, Zipangu (1980), leaves an impression as lasting as his Pulau Dewata succeeds in invoking atmospheres typical of the Balinese gamelan sound world.
