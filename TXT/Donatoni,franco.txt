Donatoni, Franco (b. 1927-2000)
Mitch Renaud

Composer and poet Franco Donatoni studied in Vienna before attending the
Darmstadt summer music program where he encountered Pierre Boulez and
Karlheinz Stockhausen, among others. Donatoni took to the serial practices
of Darmstadt but attempted to join them with John Cages project of
separating the composers ego from the work of art.

These encounters eventually led him to apply what he referred to as codes
to his often found or borrowed material. In any given mature work the codes
operate on multiple levels controlling all musical parameters. His early
experiments with codes, such as Etwas Ruhiger im Ausdruck (1967) aim for
the creation of a work that is completely autonomous from its maker.

Donatonis thinking gradually changed to acknowledge his role in the
deployment of codes. Works like La souris sans sourire (1988) for string
quartet show what he has referred to as his joyous period, where he employs
a wider range of materials. One of the clearest examples of codes is his
last piece Esa (In Cauda V) [2000], written for his student Esa-Pekka
Salonen. It uses the musical spelling of Esas name and material from The
Rite of Spring.
