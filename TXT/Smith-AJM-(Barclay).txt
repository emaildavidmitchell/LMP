Smith, (James Marshall) Arthur (1902-1980)

A.J.M. Smith was a poet, scholar, and anthologist of Canadian literature.
As an editor of little magazines and anthologies, Smith was an important
figure in the founding of Canadian modernism.

Born on November 8, 1902 to English parents, Smith grew up in Westmont,
Quebec. He studied at McGill University (1921-1926), obtaining a B. Sc.
(Arts) and an M.A. His Masters thesis was on the poetry of W.B. YEATS.
Smith associated with F.R. SCOTT, A.M. KEIN, Leo KENNEDY, and Leon EDEL,
the circle of Montreal poets who, influenced by T.S. ELIOT and ANGLO-
AMERICAN MODERNISM, sought to establish the practice of modernist poetry in
Canada in order to counter the Victorian-style Confederation Poets of the
early twentieth century.

As an undergraduate student, Smith founded and edited the Literary
Supplement of the McGill Daily. He continued his editorial efforts as a
graduate student, creating, with Scott in 1925, the McGill Fortnightly
Reviewthe first journal of modernist writing in Canada. The journal helped
initiate the tradition of LITTLE MAGAZINES in Canada, publishing the surge
of Canadian modernist poetry in the 1920s and 1930s. After marrying Jeanne
Dougall Robins in 1927, he began his PhD at University of Edinburgh and
completed his dissertation, Studies in the Metaphysical Poets of the
Anglican Church in the 17th Century, in 1931. Smith worked as a professor
at Michigan State University (1936-1972).

Smith anonymously co-edited with Kennedy and Scott the first anthology of
modernist verse in Canada, New Provinces (1936). Featuring the poetry of
Klein, Kennedy, Smith, Scott, E.J. PRATT, and R. FINCH, the anthology
announced the arrival of a new generation of poets on the Canadian literary
scene. While now seen as an achievement in the development of Canadian
modernism, the publication suffered poor sales and the publisher rejected
Smiths modernist manifesto preface.

American modernist magazines, The Dial, New Verse, and Poetry, regularly
published Smiths poetry, and he was awarded the Harriet Monroe Memorial
Prize by Poetry in 1941. Smith established himself as both a poet and a
critic in 1943 when he published his first collection of poetry, News of
the Phoenix, winner of the Governor Generals Literary Award, and the
anthology, The Book of Canadian Poetry. The Book was the first
comprehensive collection of Canadian poetry to include modernist poets. In
the anthology, Smith distinguishes between two voicesnative and
cosmopolitanin Canadian literature, characterizing the former as
concerned with portraits of Canadian life and the latter as focused on
international cultural debates.

Smith published his last volume of new poetry, A Sort of Ecstasy, in 1954.
His prolific critical output and anthologizing projects eclipsed his
reputation as a poet, although recent scholarship has begun to re-evaluate
his poetry. Smith went on to edit several anthologies, including The Oxford
Book of Canadian Verse (1960), a bilingual compendium of Canadian poetry.
He died on November 21, 1980 in East Lansing, Michigan. As a prominent
scholar of Canadian literature, Smith contributed to the foundation and
recognition of a modernist literary tradition in Canada.
