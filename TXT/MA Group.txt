The Hungarian avant-garde MA (Today) group was founded by  Lajos  Kassk  in
1916 as a successor of A Tett (The Act),  which  had  been  banned  in  1915
because of its anti-militarist stance. The MA magazine was characterised  by
anti-militarism, Expressionist positions in literature and the visual  arts,
and international aspirations. The authors of MA were the left-wing  writers
and  poets  Aladr  Komjt,  Sndor  Barta  and  Barta   Lajos,   who   were
collaborating with the Berliner magazines Der  Sturm  and  Die  Aktion.  All
members of  the  group  emigrated  to  Berlin  after  the  collapse  of  the
Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919.
Through MA, the Hungarian avant-garde was  linked  to  the  European  avant-
garde. Kassk was the first Hungarian artist who maintained  connections  to
similar European artist groups such as De Stijl, The  Tempest,  Die  Aktion.
For Kassk and his group, the activities of Die Aktion served as an  example
of a politically radical socialism. Kassk published articles and  poems  of
members of Die Aktion. MA  also  had  close  ties  to  Der  Sturm,  Herwarth
Waldens gallery and  magazine  in  Berlin.  MA  artists,  including  Rbert
Berny, Lajos Kassk, Lajos Tihanyi, Lszl  Moholy-Nagy  and  Lszl  Peri,
exhibited their works in the Sturm gallery after 1919. The MA group  brought
not  only  a   unique   revolutionary,   politically   engaged   avant-garde
perspective into Hungarian intellectual life before World War  I,  but  also
served as a link between Hungarian and European modernism.
