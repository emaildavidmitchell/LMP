Sir Michael (Kemp) Tippett (1905-1998)
Edward Venn

Michael Tippett was one of the leading British composers of the twentieth
century. His music and his writings are characterised by an enduring
commitment to humanist values and traditions, mediated by an increasingly
ironic and critically self-aware modern subjectivity.

Born into a relatively affluent middle-class family from rural Suffolk,
Tippetts life at home and at boarding school cultivated his life-long
intellectual curiosity and independence, but provided him with a patchy
musical education. Adamant that he would nevertheless be a composer, he
enrolled twice at the Royal College of Music where he painstakingly sought
to develop both compositional technique and a heightened awareness of
(Western classical) musical tradition.

The experience of the global economic depression in the first half of the
1930s, heightened by working with unemployed musicians and providing
musical opportunities at North Yorkshire work camps, politicised his
nascent left-wing sensibilities; a brief spell in the British Communist
party ended due to the incompatibility of his Trotskyist orientation with
the prevailing Stalinist thought. A more lasting commitment came through
his pacifism, for which he was jailed in 1943; having joined the Peace
Pledge Union in 1940, he went on to serve on its council in the 1950s and
was Honorary President from 1958 until his death.

The end of a six-year relationship with the painter Wilfred Franks prompted
a course of Jungian analysis, through which Tippett came to the conclusion
that music could provide a corrective to the psychological and spiritual
ruptures of modernity. This, in conjunction with concurrent conversations
about the nature of art with T.S Eliot, who Tippett was later to describe
as a spiritual mentor, resulted in the oratorio A CHILD OF OUR TIME (1939-
41). The subject of the oratorio is ostensibly the assassination of the
German diplomat Ernst von Rath by the Polish Jew Herschel Grynzpan in 1938,
and the subsequent pogrom in Germany (the Kristallnacht), though the
underlying argument centres on the potentially catastrophic consequences of
the lack of (Jungian) self-knowledge. The work reflects the influence of
Eliot in its multiple stylistic, musical and literary allusions and
quotations; the use of negro spirituals to universalise the underlying
message of the work is not without controversy.

Tippett continued to explore the musical and philosophical implications of
the oratorio in works both non-texted (STRING QUARTET No. 2 (1941-42),
SYMPHONY No. 1 (1944-45) and texted: THE MIDSUMMER MARRIAGE (1946-52)
offers an extended allegory of the Jungian process of individuation,
offering a wider frame of reference and altogether more positive conclusion
than any work of Tippetts at that time, and far from the concerns of his
contemporaries.

Reflecting on the changing feel of our time in the 1950s, Tippetts music
began to evince a shift in sensibilities from the bracing yet affirmative
qualities offered as a corrective to the war years to a stance that
rejected the increasing faith in scientific rationalism. The SYMPHONY No. 2
(1956-7), on the surface an invigorating reappraisal of the symphonic genre
in the light of Stravinskian neo-classicism, is musically poised between
the hard-won tonal and textural richness of Tippetts earlier music and the
music of the coming decades.   By the early 1960s, and with the opera KING
PRIAM (1958-61), this process came to fruition with an apparent change of
style from rich lyricism and driving rhythms to a fragmented, rebarbative
language that seemed to owe much to late Stravinsky and the new music being
written in continental Europe. In a string of works in the 1960s and early
1970s, Tippetts music is characterised by the presentation of a fragmented
subjectivity that nevertheless strives for some measure of reconciliation,
as in The Vision of Saint Augustine for baritone solo, chorus and orchestra
(1963-5), the opera The Knot Garden (1966-9), Songs for Dov for tenor and
small orchestra (1969-70) and the Symphony No. 3 (1970-2). The latter three
works in particular foreground the use of musical quotations, complementing
the use of literary quotations that had been a feature of Tippetts self-
penned libretti from the outset.

Tippetts penchant for lyricism, mostly suppressed during the 1960s,
returns as a counterbalance to the more abrasive material, as in The Triple
Concerto for violin, viola, cello and orchestra (1978-9) and THE ROSE LAKE
(1991-93). At the same time the questioning of certaintiesphilosophical,
artistic, scientific and musicalcontinues to colour his later music. The
SYMPHONY No. 3 offers a critique of the humanist message of Beethovens
Ninth Symphony, and in THE MASK OF TIME (1980-82) Tippett explores
mankinds continued and ultimately unsuccessful attempts to comprehend the
world through artistic, religious and scientific means. In both cases, and
in the operas THE ICE BREAK (1973-6) and NEW YEAR (1985-88), affirmation
and hope is counterbalanced by ironic undercutting that questions both the
possibilities of such states as well as the ability of art to effect
meaningful spiritual transformations.
