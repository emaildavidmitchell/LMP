BULGAKOV, Mikhail Afanasevich (, )
(1891-1940)

Russian prose writer and playwright.  In the last twenty-five years of the
Soviet Unions existence Mikhail Bulgakov became one of its most widely
read and performed writers.  This reception, which rescued Bulgakov from
near obscurity, occurred posthumously with the partial publication of the
novel Master i Margarita (Master and Margarita, written 1928-1940,
partially published 1966-7, fully published 1973).  Bulgakov experienced
severe censorship, especially after the success of his play about a
monarchist, Kievan family during the years of the Russian Revolution and
Civil War, Dni Turbinykh (The Days of the Turbins, 1926), a play that
became the favourite of Joseph Stalin.  For the rest of his professional
and personal life Bulgakov struggled with the ambivalence of Stalins
favour: he survived the Stalinist repression that took the lives and
productivity of so many of his peers, and yet his works were repeatedly
banned.  In his writing Bulgakov addressed the moral and personal crises he
experienced (war, revolution, censorship, hypocrisy, Soviet ideology,
totalitarianism) with a unique mixture of literary fantasy, grotesque,
humour, and irony.

Bulgakov was born 15 May (3 May Old Style) 1891, into a family that
belonged to the pre-Revolutionary Russian intelligentsia.  Although he was
born and grew up in Kiev, he learned the language of the Russian literary
canon from an early age.  He attended medical school, became a specialist
in venereal disease with a private practice in Kiev, and served as a doctor
in World War I and during the Revolution in various towns and regions.
Bulgakov depicted the cruelty and hypocrisy he witnessed working as a
doctor during the Revolution and Civil War in his first literary works
Griadushchie perspektivy (Future Prospects, 1919), V kafe (In the
Cafe, 1920), and later works like Neobyknovennye prikliucheniia doktora
(The Unusual Adventures of a Doctor, 1922), Zapiski iunogo vracha (Notes of
a Young Doctor, 1925-26), and Morfii (Morphine, 1927).  These early themes
and images find fullest expression in his play The Days of the Turbins and
the novel upon which it is based, Belaia gvardia (White Guard, 1923-24).

In September of 1921, as the Civil War drew to its close, Bulgakov moved
from Kiev to Moscow, where, having abandoned his medical practice, he found
employment at various literary establishments.  He wrote short stories and
feuilletons during these first, hungry years of the Soviet Union.  The
ironies of life during the New Economic Policy (NEP, 1921-1928), which
began just as Bulgakov arrived from Kiev, inspired short works like Moskva
krasnokamennaia (Red-stoned Moscow, 1922), No. 13.  Dom Elpit-
Rabkommuna (No. 13.  Elpit-Rabkommun Building, 1922), Samogonnoe ozero
(Moonshine Lake, 1923), Rokovye iatsa (The Fatal Eggs, 1924) and Sobache
serdtse (The Heart of a Dog, 1925).  The end of NEP and the beginning of
Stalins consolidation of power mark Bulgakovs move to yet another stage
of his oeuvre: in 1928 he began the first sketches of what would eventually
become Master and Margarita.  Although he worked on that novel until days
before his death, he never authorised a final version.  In 1939 Bulgakov
suffered severe migraines and loss of vision and was diagnosed with
malignant nephrosclerosis, the same condition that caused his fathers
early death at age 48.  He died 10 March 1940.

Between 1926 and his death in 1940 Bulgakov wrote ten original plays
Zoikina kvartira (Zoikas Apartment, 1926), Beg (Flight, 1927), Bagrovyi
ostrov (The Crimson Island, 1927), Kabala sviatosh (A Cabal of Hypocrites,
1929), Blazhenstvo (Bliss, 1929), Moler (Molire, 1930),  Adam i Eva (Adam
and Eve, 1930),  Poslednie dni (The Last Days, 1934), Ivan Vasilievich
(Ivan Vasilievich, 1935), Batum (Batum, 1938), a biography of Molire,
Zhizn gospodina de Molera (1933) and among still other literary works,
Master and Margarita.  Bulgakov never saw most of these works performed or
published.

Out of this prolific but increasingly silent period, Master and Margarita,
often referred to as his sunset novel, ensured Bulgakovs literary fame.
In the novel, an account of the devils visit to Soviet Moscow parallels an
account of a young Soviet poets crisis after hearing the text of a
repressed writer recited by the devil.  Despite the twenty-six year gulf
between the writing of the novel and its reception, readers immediately
resonated with the novels complex allusions to narratives of Faust and
Christ and the works of Russian masters like Pushkin, Gogol, and
Dostoevsky, mixed with hilarious parodies of Bulgakovs contemporary
writers.  Furthermore, Bulgakovs innovative use of Moscow as setting
quickly produced a number of pilgrimage sites for fans of the novel in the
Soviet capital: readers diligently sought out prototypes for Margaritas
mansion, The Spring Ball of the Full Moon, Griboedov House, and especially
Apartment 50.  Both international and Russian admirers have covered the
stairs that lead up to the assumed prototype for apartment 50 at Bolshaia
Sadovaia 10 with images and quotes from the novel for decades.  Almost
overnight the novel achieved cult status among members of the
intelligentsia for its satire of Soviet society and speculative
metaphysics, a combination that continues to make Master and Margarita one
of the most culturally significant Soviet novels.
