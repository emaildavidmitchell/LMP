Richards, I. A. (1893-1979)
Ivor Armstrong Richards was a leading British critic of the twentieth
century. Born in Cheshire and educated at Cambridge, Richards founded his
reputation on his ability to evaluate problems of meaning in communicative
acts. His contributions led to the development of modern literary
criticism, especially New Criticism. He drew on philosophy, rhetoric,
semantics, semiotics and aesthetic theory to illustrate how language works
by usage, rather than by prescriptive rules. While taking forms of poetry
as the basis of his study in the 1920s, he developed with C. K. Ogden (1889-
1957) methods of close reading that brought attention to contexts of
interpretation. Early books like The Principles of Literary Criticism
(1924) and Practical Criticism (1929) focus primarily on interpretive
possibilities in poetry, emphasizing that readers can easily arrive at
textual misunderstandings. His interest in communication and psychology led
him to rhetoric as a way to address misunderstanding and its remedies
(Richards 1936, 3). The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1936) introduced concerns
that remain influential in rhetorical studies today, especially concepts
regarding the metaphoricity of language, meaning and context in the
formation of thought. A popular classroom teacher, Richards contributed
significantly to the development of modern English Studies.
