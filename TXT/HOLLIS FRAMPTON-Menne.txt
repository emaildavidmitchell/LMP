Frampton, Hollis

Jeff Menne (Oklahoma State University)

Hollis Frampton (1936-1984) was born in Ohio in 1936 and raised by maternal
grandparents. He attended Phillips Academy, there befriending future
artists Carl Andre and Frank Stella. In 1957 he began visiting Ezra Pound,
then at St. Elizabeths Hospital, in Washington DC. Their relationship,
Frampton says, taught him he was not, as he first thought, a poet. He moved
to New York City in 1958 with the intention of pursuing an artistic career
at the moment when the centrality of painting as main medium of avant-garde
experimentation was being questioned by the rise of other media, such as
photography, film, installation, and performance. He first took up
photography, then settled on film in the 1960s. His best known titles,
Zorns Lemma (1970) and (nostalgia) (1971), evince a modernist drive for
order, often drawn from principles of science and mathematics. Frampton was
central to Structural Film, a movement comprising as well Michael Snow,
Paul Sharits, Ernie Gehr, and Ken Jacobs, among many others. As Abstract
Expressionist painters had done before, structural filmmakers foregrounded
the specific properties of their medium. Many of Framptons films belong to
the large, multipart projects Hapax Legomena and Magellan, the latter a
vast work of metahistory left incomplete at his death in 1984. In his
last decade he helped develop the influential Center for Media Study at
SUNY Buffalo and his interests turned to video and digital arts.

Zryd calls a ludic modernism.)
