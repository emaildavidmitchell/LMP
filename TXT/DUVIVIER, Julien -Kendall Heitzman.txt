DUVIVIER, Julien (8 October 1896- 29 October 1967)

Julien Duvivier was a Golden Age French film director active from the 1919
to the 1960s.  He made a name for himself in the 1930s as the director of a
series of films treating people on the down and out with a light touch.  In
Poil de carotte (1932), based on the novel by Jules Renard, a redheaded boy
shunned by his parents makes his way in the world.  Le paquebot Tenacity
(S.S. Tenacity, 1934) shows two adventurers stuck in port trying to make
their way to Canada (where there is less competition than in the United
States), but falling in love in the meantime.  In Un Carnet de Bal (Dance
Program, 1937), a melodramatic mixture of pathos and comedy, a woman tracks
down the men from her first dance card twenty years earlier.  Duvivier is
most famous for Pp le Moko (1937), about attempts to bring the outlaw
Pp, played by Jean Gabin, out of the seething tangletown of the Casbah of
Algiers to justice; today the film is regarded as a touchstone for
discourse on Orientalism and postcolonialism, as well as a prime example of
the poetic realism that flourished in French cinema in the 1930s: a
working-class antihero dies for love of a woman.  Despite Duviviers
reputation as a journeyman filmmaker, John Cromwell imitated much of Pp
le Moko shot for shot when he remade the film for United Artists as Algiers
(1938).  Duvivier spent the war years in the United States, making films in
Hollywood, but he returned to France after the war, where he pursued
filmmaking until the end of his life.
