Gilberto Mendes
Mrcio Bezerra
      Gilberto Ambrsio Garcia Mendes was born in Santos (So Paulo state),
on 13 October 1922.  Despite his unorthodox musical career  he did not
start to study music until the age of nineteen, and, in addition, worked in
a bank until his retirement in 1975  he has achieved wide recognition as
one of the leading Brazilian composers of the present.  He is a local
pioneer in the fields of chance, concrte, and microtonal music, mixed
media, and musical action.
      Professor, lecturer, and contributor to many newspapers and
magazines, Mendes is the founder and director of the Festival Msica Nova
de Santos (Santos New Music Festival), the oldest concert series of its
kind in Latin America (1962).  As a scholar, he has served as Visiting
Professor and University Artist in the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee
(19781979), and as Tinker Visiting Professor and Composer in Residence in
the University of Texas at Austin (1983).  In 1994, the Universidade de So
Paulo granted him a Ph.D. in Music, and since then, he has retired,
remaining on the faculty as Honors Professor for Graduate Studies.
      Compositions by Gilberto Mendes have been performed at main musical
events in Brazil and abroad, such as the Festival de Amrica y Espaa
(Spain), the Autumn of Warsaw (Poland), the Festival International des
Musiques Experimentales de Bourges (France), the Darmstadt Festival
(Germany), the Nutida Musik (Sweden), the International Festival of Patras
(Greece), the Inter-American Music Festival (Washington, D.C.), the New
World Festival of Arts (Miami), and the Sonidos de Amrica (Carnegie Hall,
New York).
      Mendes first musical studies began as a hobby, when he enrolled at
the Conservatrio Musical de Santos.  At that time, the institution was
owned by the great Brazilian pianist Antonieta Rudge (18851974), who
accepted him as a pupil.  However, he would not begin to feel enthusiastic
about his studies until 1944, when he undertook a more profound study of
harmony with Savino de Benedicts (18831971)  a conservative but highly
competent instructor.  It was then that Mendes decided to become a
composer; his initial efforts to write music are dated from those years.
      His first works are mainly short piano pieces (the earliest surviving
production is a Preldio of 1945) and songs, which show a pronounced
influence of the classical and romantic past, combined, at times, with
Brazilian folk music elements.  Although Benedicts tried to give Mendes
some orientation on those attempts, the old master did not approve the
harmonic liberties taken by him  especially the flattened chromaticisms
that he often employed, under the influence of the American popular music
(especially the big bands) he heard on the radio.  Because of that
disagreement, Gilberto Mendes opted to become an autodidact; the only
tuition that he acquired on those years came from his readings of
theoretical books and from a careful study of the old masters scores.
      Another important influence came from cinema, which not only inspired
Mendes through its music, but also provided him with a personal mythology
that he would adopt almost as a religion.  Despite the fact that the
composer did not experience direct contact with musical folklore during his
youth, nationalism was another source of inspiration, thanks mainly to his
involvement with the Communist Party during the 1950s.
      Around that time, he tried to study with the leading nationalist
composer, Mozart Camargo Guarnieri (19071993).  After this unsuccessful
attempt, Mendes approached Cludio Santoro (19191989), who was then fully
converted to nationalism.  Their contact was brief, consisting of five
lessons in which they discussed more ideological aspects of musical
aesthetics than compositional techniques.  In spite of that, most of Mendes
pieces from that period are characterized by a relaxed approach to
nationalism, reflecting more the influences of composers such as Heitor
Villa-Lobos (18871959) and Ernesto Nazareth (18631934) than the preaching
of Camargo Guarnieri and his disciples.
      After Santoros departure to Europe, Gilberto Mendes became involved,
in 1956, with a group of musicians that had gathered around George Olivier
Toni (b. 1926).  Toni, who was also a communist, freed Mendes from his
ideological concerns, and introduced him to avant-garde techniques.  Among
the works from that period are the Peas para Piano nos. 1416 and 6 Peas
para Piano Solo, from which no. 5 was Mendes first twelve-tone
composition.
      In 1959, during a trip to Europe, the composer became aware of the new
trends in composition, discovering the music of Karlhienz Stockhausen
(19282007).  Upon his return to Brazil, Mendes immersed himself  along
with his fellow composers Willy Corra de Oliveira (b. 1938) and Rogrio
Duprat (19322006)  in a study of Integral Serialism that would result in
the works Cantata sobre a Fala Inicial do Romanceiro da Incofidncia (now
Cavalo azul, 1961), Msica para 12 Instrumentos (1961), and Msica para
Piano n 1 (1962).
      In 1962 Mendes and his colleagues went to the Summer Course of
Darmstadt, in which they expected to receive classes on Integral Serialism
with Stockhausen.  For their surprise, they found an environment that had
been shaken four years earlier by a series of lectures by John Cage
(19121992), in which the American composer defended the use of chance and
indeterminacy of music making.  That shock was a turning point for the
Brazilian composers who either abandoned art music altogether (in the cases
of Rogrio Duprat and Damiano Cozella [b. 1929]) or opened themselves to
experimentalism (as happened with Willy Corra de Oliveira and Mendes
himself).
      Upon their return to Brazil, the composers, then a part of the Grupo
Msica Nova, published a manifesto in the literary magazine Inveno.  The
Manifesto Msica Nova advocated the artists total immersion into the
contemporary world, proposing a balance between a formalist approach to
music making and political messaging.  During that period Mendes
collaborated closely with avant-garde poets of Poesia Concreta, a
partnership that would result in his most experimental and celebrated
compositions: the choral works.  Up to that time, Mendes pieces were
virtually unknown to but a few colleagues; his appearance in Brazilian
musical scene during this phase of experimentalism would involve his name,
for years to come, into an aura of scandal and controversy.
      An exemplary work from that period is Motet em R Menor (also known as
Beba Coca-Cola [Drink Coca-Cola], 1966).  Based on a poem by Dcio
Pignatari (b. 1927), the pieces intrinsic humor conceals a sarcastic
criticism of American imperialism, through the manipulation of its main
icon.  In the poem, Pignatari develops the initial advertisement phrase
through six lines; in the final version, the phrase is transformed into the
word cloaca (which translates both as sewer and rectum), all elegantly
arranged on the page.  Mendes setting features a similar approach, for he
combined a dense contrapunctual texture, permeated with microtonal
intervals, with moments of a more direct engagement with the public,
especially after the intended burp (by as many singers as possible) that
punctuates the beginning of the coda.  Prior to the last measure, the
conductor faces the audience, and when applause starts, the choir bursts
into a protest-like declamation of the word cloaca, which is also seen in
posters waved by the singers.
      Direct communication with the audience is characteristic of other
works from that period, such as Cidade (1964), Vai e Vem (1969), and
Asthmatour (1971) for choir, and Santos Football Music (1969) for
orchestra, tapes of soccer game broadcasts, and audience participation.
      In 1975 the career of Gilberto Mendes began turning away form his
combative period of experimentalism.  In that year, he finally retired from
his bank job, and a growth in productivity was the most immediate
consequence of his new status.  The pieces from that period  such as
Motetos  Feio de Lobo de Mesquita (1975) for baritone, oboe,
violoncello, and harpsichord  feature an increased importance of the
instrumental parts, contrasting with the vocal prominence of the previous
works.  In 1978, a residency in the United States  where he taught
composition for the academic year at the University of Wisconsin at
Milwaukee  enhanced Mendes interest for instrumental music.
      In fact, the composers immersion into a culture that he had so much
admired, through popular music and movies, would have a direct impact in
his subsequent works, such as Qualquer Msica (1980) for chamber ensemble,
and Saudades do Parque Balnerio Hotel (1980) for alto saxophone and piano.
 This latter piece also has an autobiographical character  the hotel,
destroyed to make way for a shopping mall, was one of the places where
Mendes heard popular music during the 1940s  that would become a specific
feature of many of his mature works.  In them, he turned to his personal
mythology  formed mainly by stars of Hollywood musicals and artists linked
with German Expressionism  in search of inspiration and musical material.
Another typical trend of mature compositions, like Saudades do Parque
Balnerio Hotel, is the use of musical quotations.
      In 1981, after a gap of twenty years, Mendes returned to the piano as
a creative medium with the Concerto para Piano e Orquestra, the first
mature instrumental work to summon the attention of the critics to his
stylistic shift.  The reactions to the piece varied from cautionary
newspaper critiques to enthusiastic commentaries.
      In the spring of 1983 the composer returned to the United States, as
Tinker Visiting Professor at the University of Texas at Austin.  During
that period he continued to write pieces influenced by jazz, but also
started to reevaluate his early works, especially the piano pieces.  An
example is Recado a Schumann (1983), a work composed in Austin, on a theme
composed many decades earlier.
      Upon his return to Brazil, Mendes would receive many commissions to
write choral and instrumental pieces.  The countrys process of
redemocratization that started in 1984 prompted him to write some works
politically charged  such as Vila Soc Meu Amor (1984), Mame Eu Quero
Votar (1984), Vo Entregar as Estatais!... (1985), and 1 de Maio (1986)
for choir, and O ltimo Tango em Vila Parisi (1987) for orchestra 
although most of his instrumental pieces continue to reflect his dialogue
with his own past  such as Ulisses em Copacabana Surfando com James Joyce
e Dorothy Lamour (1986) for chamber ensemble and Um Estudo? Eisler e Webern
Caminham nos Mares do Sul... (1989).
      During the last decades, Mendes has enjoyed a revision by Brazilian
critics and musicologists, who now openly regard him as a leading figure
among contemporary composers.  As a result of this new status, many of his
early works are being revived in concerts and also through recordings.
Also, he has been receiving commissions more often and his creative output
has experienced a dramatic increase in quantity.
      In his present works, Gilberto Mendes has achieved the mastery of many
techniques he has been employing since his youth  such as the use of
pervasive repetition and musical quotation  combined with an attempt to
reconcile the tonal and atonal musical universes, which is responsible for
the unique sound of his pieces.
