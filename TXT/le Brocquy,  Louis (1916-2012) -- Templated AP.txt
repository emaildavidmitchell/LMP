In 1958, le Brocquy moved to the South of France with his wife, the painter Ann Madden, remaining there until their return to Dublin in 2000. His painting A Family (1951) won the Prealpina Painting Prize at the Venice Biennale in 1958; after having been rejected by the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin in the 1950s, it finally entered the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland in 2000. A Family addresses Cold War anxieties through a reading of both Picasso and Manet; the Presences series (1954-1964) examined the female body through a visual language close to the French Inform (l’Informe). However, a significant theme in le Brocquy’s work from the 1960s onwards utilised the Celtic cult of the head as a basis for studies of modernist artists and writers including Francis Bacon, James Joyce and Federico García Lorca, thus firmly located Irish identity within the wider context of European modernism.
