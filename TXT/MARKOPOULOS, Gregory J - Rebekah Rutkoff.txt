MARKOPOULOS, Gregory J. (March 12, 1928-November 12, 1992)

Gregory J. Markopoulos was an American experimental filmmaker and one of
the key figures in the New American Cinema group of the 1960s. Born in
Toledo, Ohio, the son of Greek immigrants, Markopoulos spoke only Greek
until age six, made his first 8mm film at age twelve, and studied at the
University of Southern California, attending classes with Josef von
Sternberg and observing film productions of Fritz Lang and Alfred
Hitchcock. Ancient mythology and his Greek heritage were life-long
touchstones; symbolic colour, intensive montage and radical single frame
operations are consistent hallmarks of his work. Insistent on the divine
potential of cinema, he saw himself as a filmmaker-physician. He drew on
literary sources  Plato, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Jean Cocteau, Honor de
Balzac, and Elias Venezis  for many of his films.  Psyche (1947) was
inspired by Pierre Lous's unfinished novella of the same name and, with
the addition of the subsequent Lysis and Charmides, formed the trilogy Du
sang, de la volupt et de la mort (1947  48). Twice a Man (1963) is based
on the story of Hippolytus; The Illiac Passion (1964-1967) is a retelling
of Aeschyluss Prometheus Bound that stars Andy Warhol and Jack Smith. In
1966 he began producing in-camera filmsportraits of people and placesby
running a single roll of film stock back and forth inside the camera,
creating superimpositions and fades at predetermined points. Ming Green
(1966), a portrait of his New York City apartment, was the first of this
type. Bliss (1967), a study of the interior of the Church of St. John on
the island of Hydra, Gammelion (1968), a portrait of an Italian castello in
Rieti that features fragments of Rilkes poetry read by the filmmaker, and
many others followed. He lectured extensively and frequently contributed to
Jonas Mekas Film Culture magazine in the 1960s; he also was a poet.
Discontent with screening and distribution conditions, Markopoulos left the
United States in 1967 with his long-time partner, the American filmmaker
Robert Beavers, and lived in various European locations until his death,
removing his films from distribution and refusing screenings. He edited his
final film, the magnum opus Eniaios (Greek for unity or uniqueness), a
silent 80-hour reworking of his previous film output, during the last
decade of his life. It was created for exclusive viewing near his ancestral
home in Lyssaraia (in the Peloponnesus) at an event and site he called the
Temenos (ancient Greek for sacred space or a place set apart). He hoped
to build a theatre and archive for his and Beaverss work there. Eniaios
was fully edited, but not yet printed, at the time of his death. It is
composed of 22 cycles and contains 100 individual titles. Since
Markopouloss death, Beavers has worked to preserve Eniaios and has
overseen the printing of eight cycles. He has organized outdoor screenings
at the Temenos location in 2004, 2008 and 2012 where portions of Eniaios
have been presented.
