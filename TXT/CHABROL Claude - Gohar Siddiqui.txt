CLAUDE CHABROL (b. 23 June 1930, Sardent, France; d. 12 September 2010, Paris, France)



Claude Chabrol was a French director, screen-writer, and producer, 20th century Fox’s public relations man, and a critic. He had also contributed to the influential film journal Les Cahiers du Cinema before turning to filmmaking. One of the core directors of the French New Wave known for their self-reflexive cinematic modernism, he was a proponent of auteur theory. His film Le Beau Serge (Handsome Serge, 1958) is considered one of the first films of the New Wave and sets up some of its defining characteristics: unknown performers as actors, low budget, use of documentary style, and expressionist cinematography. 



Chabrol’s style differed from the experimental style of Godard but he was still invested in aesthetics and self-referentiality. His films reveal his love for the conventions of plot and genre as well as the influence of Alfred Hitchcock. But his use of mise-en-scène and camerawork often exposed the pretense and emptiness at the heart of bourgeois life. His films also portrayed the “new woman” who was modern, sensual, and authentic. Stephane Audran, his then wife, played this role in several of his films including La Femme Infidele (Unfaithful Wife, 1968), Les Biches (The Does, 1968), and Le Boucher (The Butcher, 1970).
