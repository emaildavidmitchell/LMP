Knussen, Oliver (b. 1952)

Edward Venn

British composer and conductor.

The son of a double bassist in the London Symphony Orchestra, Knussen came
to prominence when he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the
premiere of his (subsequently withdrawn) first Symphony, aged only 14.
Knussen's background, combined with his studies with John Lambert (1963-69)
and Gunther Schuller (1970-73), left him with an extensive knowledge of the
repertoire. His music represents a refined synthesis of a range of sources,
many of which located in the first half of the twentieth century, as in the
SYMPHONY No. 2 (1971), setting poems by Trakl. Knussen's early fame came at
a cost; works were often presented as fragments (and frequently revised
after that), or commissions left unfulfilled. Nevertheless, in works such
as OPHELIA DANCES BOOK 1 (1975) and the SYMPHONY No. 3 (1979), both of
which eventually shorter than originally planned, Knussen's growing
technical facility and propensity for detailed and complex layering of
material, demonstrated his growing confidence. The metrical schemes found
in the music of Carter, along with the pitch permutations inherited from
Krenek and Stravinsky, play important roles in his technical armoury.

In his two 'fantasy operas', WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE (1979/83) and
HIGGLETY PIGGLETY POP! (1984-5; rev. 1999), written in collaboration with
the artist Maurice Sendak, Knussen looked back to the tradition instigated
by Humperdinck and Ravel in works such as Hansel und Gretel and Lenfant et
les sortilges. The music is rich with allusion to composers such as
Mussorgsky and Debussy, integrated into Knussen's own language.

Subsequent works continued to develop Knussen's concerns, albeit over
shorter, more concentrated spans of music. In works such as FLOURISH WITH
FIREWORKS (1993; it is closely related to Stravinsky's Feu dartifice) and
the TWO ORGANA (1995), intricate musical workings are combined with equally
detailed larger scale planning. More recently, with pieces such as the HORN
CONCERTO (1994), VIOLIN CONCERTO (2002) and REQUIEM: SONGS FOR SUE (2006),
Knussen draws more on compositional intuitions honed by decades of careful
pre-compositional structuring, with a consequent increase in emotional
immediacy.

As a conductor, Knussen has championed the music of a catholic range of
twentieth century and contemporary composers.
