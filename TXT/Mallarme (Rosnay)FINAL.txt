Mallarm, Stphane (tienne) (1842-1898)

(Mallarm by Manet, wikimedia commons)


Along with Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine, Stphane Mallarm is a
preeminent poet of the latter part of the 19th century, notably as the head
of Symbolism (with Verlaine). Like many of his generation, Mallarm built
upon Charles Baudelaire, Thophile Gautier and Edgar Allan Poes
contributions to poetry and criticism, and anticipated the various
Modernist and avant-garde movements to come, being a key voice of
modernism. Mallarm is mostly known for his very difficult, hermetic
language, for his conceptualisation of a crisis of verse (crise de
vers), and for his innovations in versification and free verse.

Biography

tienne Mallarm, commonly known as Stphane, was born in Paris to Numa
Mallarm, a government administrator, and lisabeth Desmolins, who died
when Stphane was 5, after which point Stphane came, along with his sister
Maria, under the tutelage of his grandfather. His father remarried Anne-
Hubertine Lonide Mathieu, who had three girls and a son. Mallarms
performance at school was mediocre, and his teachers at Passy reproached
him for his rebellious and vain character; he was subsequently expelled
in 1855. His first poems date from 1854. He was deeply affected by the
death of his sister in 1857, as testified in some early prose (Ce que
disaient les trois cigognes, Plainte dautomne).

After first failing his exams, Mallarm got his high-school diploma
(baccalaurat) in 1860. In November 1862, he travelled to London with Marie
Gerhard, whom he would marry in 1863, the year his father died. Mallarm
became an English teacher at Tournon. Marie and Stphane had their first
child, Genevive, in 1864. The following year, Mallarm sent Thodore
Banville the first version of L'Aprs-midi d'un faune. In the years between
1864 and 1866, Mallarm began literary friendships with figures such as
Frdric Mistral, Catulle Mends, Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Paul Verlaine
and Franois Coppe. In 1866, the Parnasse contemporain, a well-known
poetry journal, published some of Mallarms poems. The same year, he left
Tournon for Besanon due to difficulties with teaching and parents of
pupils, and a year later, he started teaching in Avignon. The years 1867 to
1869 are difficult as they are characterized by fundamental doubt, and he
wrote very little all the way through to 1873. His son Anatole was born in
1871, the same year Mallarm sought employment in England and subsequently
moved to Paris. In 1873, Mallarm befriended the painter Manet and wrote
his famous Toast funbre in honour of Gautier who died the previous year.
In 1875, Mallarm translated Poes The Raven with illustrations by
Edouard Manet. A deluxe edition of L'Aprs-midi d'un faune appeared in
1876, and the following year Les Mots anglais. His son Anatole died in
1879, which inspired his later poem Tombeau pour Anatole. His George Cox-
inspired Les Dieux antiques, manuel de mythologie was published in 1880.
With the appearance of Verlaines Les Potes maudits (1880) and Huysmans 
Rebours (1881), both which praise him, Mallarm became an established
literary figure. In the years between 1884-1889, which saw his growing
status as a poet, he had an affair with Mry Laurent. His Posies, the
first collection of his poetry, was published in 1887 in the Revue
indpendante. In 1890, he gave a series of lectures in Belgium and in
Paris, notably on the poet Villiers de LIsle Adam. In 1894, the year he
took his retirement, he gave two now-famous lectures, at Oxford and
Cambridge, on the topic of Music and Letters (La Musique et les Lettres).
When Verlaine died in 1896, Mallarm was elected as the Prince des Potes
which confirmed his status and influence on subsequent generations of
poets. The widely read collection of essays, Divagations, was published a
year later. Mallarm died on the 9th of September 1898.


Mallarm contributed to many aspects of modern poetry. As well as renewing
fixed forms such as the alexandrine and the sonnet, he also pushed free
verse to new levels with his exploded visual poem Un Coup de ds. He
furthermore innovated in terms of prose criticism, writing in a highly
difficult style that is marked, as with his poetry, by a tension between
syntax and rhythm. In Contre lobscurit, Marcel Proust attacked
Symbolism, of which Mallarm was the chief, for its obscurity of ideas and
grammar. However, the obscurity of grammar and ideas are less at stake than
the uncanny nature of the images created by the tension between grammar and
imagery. His language is known as hermetic, that is, nearly inaccessible,
but it is possible to make sense of it through careful reading. Still, it
is a style that resists single readings. It is characterized by its
openness, and for the possibility of multiple readings afforded by its
ambiguities and the polysemia of the vocabulary and sentence structure.
Indeed, according to Mallarm, in a late interview with the Figaro, it is
the reader who possess the key to his poetry.

The stated goal of Mallarms style is to allow language to speak on its
own, free of the poet. The latter must relinquish all initiative to the
words (cder linitiative aux mots). When words come into contact with
each other, the force produced by such contact will create sparks, thus
creating a virtual play of meanings that only the reader can gather into
meaning. He described this process in his famous essay, Crise de vers
(Crisis of Verse), and elsewhere.

Mallarm was reacting to the common-sense notion of language as simply the
communication of ideas or the expression of feelings. Rather, he would
create a poetics of the suggestive, the indirect and the evocative
(peindre non la chose, mais leffet quelle produit, to paint not the
thing, but the effect it produces). This is similar to a painting by
Monet, where the attempt is to evoke the sensations created by the water
lilies instead of creating a perfect reproduction of them. Thus, Mallarms
language evokes sensation, often through the favouring of space
(spatialization), of mood and ambiance that would conjure a certain
feeling. This was in no way the expression of the poets own feelings, but
rather the result of high levels of craftsmanship, which continues the work
done by the lArt pour lart (art for arts sake) movement that has
characterized a key aspect of modernism.

The media context in which Mallarm was reacting is characterized by the
19th-century explosion of the press and the correlative commodification of
language, a mental foodstuff or staple, in which he saw the degradation
of the poetic into a high market of letters. His language has been
characterized as revolutionary (Kristeva) and opening up to democratic
formal expression that challenges the language of domination (Rancire,
Catani). Some have argued that Mallarms expression, albeit ambiguous,
deals within an elitist, hermetic discursive context that is a closed
literary circle exemplary of social distinction (Bourdieu). More
recently, in this line of thought, Mallarm and fellow symbolists have been
analysed as playing not just with formal criteria but with an awareness of
formalities, something which connects the poetic expression to social
discourse (e.g. Durand).

Other ways of thinking the mediality of Mallarms work involve the way in
which his poetry reflects other media. Walter Benjamin saw his famous Un
Coup de Ds as reproducing newspaper advertisements, something which
anticipate poets like Apollinaire and the textual play in Joyces Ulysses.
Recently, some have seen his poetry as reflecting the then newly emerging
cinema, and his poetry has been described as Cinepoetics (Wall-Romana).

Mallarm has had an immense impact upon twentieth-century art and
philosophy. He is seen as a primary voice for English-language Modernism,
in large part through the writings of Valry. He was a precursor of
Dadaism, Futurism and Surrealism, and was a model for OULIPO insofar as his
work plays within the bounds of formal constraint. He has also had an
impact upon music, most notably on the compositions of John Cage and Pierre
Boulez. In philosophy, Jacques Derrida saw in his poetry the play of
diffrance, Maurice Blanchot the literary space and infinite discourse of
the literature to come, Alain Badiou discusses him in connection with
ontology, and, more recently, French speculative realist Quentin
Meillassoux has affirmed Mallarms Un Coup de Ds as (de)coded.
