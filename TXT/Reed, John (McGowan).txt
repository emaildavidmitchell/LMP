Reed, John (1887-1920)
Born in Portland, Oregon in 1887, John Reed was a radical American
journalist known for his depictions of early-Twentieth Century labour
politics and political revolutions. Reed's influential works include
Insurgent Mexico (1914), an impressionistic account of the Mexican
Revolution which draws upon Reed's experiences as a reporter embedded with
revolutionary general Pancho Villa, and Ten Days That Shook the World
(1919), a firsthand portrait of Russia's Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Both
books, like Reed's shorter pieces published in The Masses and The
Metropolitan, utilized objective reporting, first person perspective, and
literary embellishment.

An aspiring poet early in his career, Reed was attracted to New York's
bohemian Greenwich Village, where he became interested in left-wing
politics and activist journalism. He married the journalist Louise Bryant
in 1916 and worked on behalf of the Bolshevik government before his death
in 1920.
