MATSUMOTO, Toshio (March 25, 1932 -)



Matsumoto Toshio is a Japanese filmmaker and video artist, most known as a pioneer in both postwar avant-garde film as well as inter-medial experiments in expanded cinema. Born in Nagoya, Matsumoto graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1955 (where he majored in aesthetics) and joined the then prestigious documentary production company Shin Riken Eiga, where he directed several PR films including Ginrin (Silver Wheels, 1955), one of the earliest examples of postwar experimental cinema emerging from an industrial promotion project. His career as a socially engaged, politically radical filmmaker thrived after leaving Shin Riken in 1959, with such avant-garde documentaries as Nishijin (The Weavers of Nishijin, 1962) and Ishi no uta (The Song of Stone, 1963) as well as with his most famous collaboration with the Art Theatre Guild, Bara no soretsu (Funeral Parade of Roses, 1969), which explored underground gay subculture in Tokyo. Matsumoto was also a prolific critic and film theorist throughout his career. Matsumoto’s influential theory of avant-garde documentary argued that the dialectic relationship between the filmmaker’s internal world and external reality should be re-situated as a dialectic between (1920s and 1930s) avant-garde and (present day) documentary modes of filmmaking. Critically examining such key issues, his 1963 monograph Discovery of the Image was widely perceived as one of the crucial theoretical inspirations for the Japanese New Wave.
