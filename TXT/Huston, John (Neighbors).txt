Huston, John (1906-1987)

John Huston was an American actor, director, and screenwriter, who became
one of the world's most influential filmmakers. Born in Missouri to Reah
Huston, a sports editor, and Walter Huston, a vaudeville actor and eventual
film star, Huston spent his early years as an artist, author, reporter,
soldier, and amateur boxer. He started out in Hollywood as a screenwriter
for Samuel Goldwyn, Universal Studios, and later for Warner Bros.. At
Warner Bros., he helped launch Humphrey Bogart's career with High Sierra
(1941). A string of successful scripts gained him his first directing job
with Maltese Falcon (1941), a film that would thrust Huston into the
limelight. In total, his career spanned over five decades, earned him 15
Oscar nominations and two Academy awards, a Golden Globe, and several
lifetime achievement awards. Huston worked in multiple genres, including
comedies, war films, musicals, westerns, adventures, and literary
adaptations. His most pronounced role, however, likely involved his
development of the modernist film noir, writing and directing several
classics of the genre, including Key Largo (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle
(1950). Many of these films call into question traditional forms of
authority, religious faith, and epistemology, and focus on protagonists who
wander the world on a journey to define their own values.
