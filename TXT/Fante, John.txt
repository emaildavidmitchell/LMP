Author John Fante[1] (April 8, 1909  May 8, 1983) is best known for his
Arturo Bandini novels, including The Road to Los Angeles (written 1933,
published 1985), Wait Until Spring, Bandini (1938), Ask the Dust[2] (1939).
While his interwar novels and short stories were met with critical acclaim,
he found far more financial success working for the film industry, where he
wrote scripts for figures such as Orson Welles while socializing with other
contract writers (such as William Faulkner[3]). His highly autobiographical
fiction frequently cited the influence of figures such as Friedrich
Nietzsche and H. L. Mencken[4] and dealt largely with the experiences of
working class Americans of Italian descent and their interactions with
other marginalized groups (particularly Filipinos, Mexicans, and Jews).
Today, Ask the Dust stands as his most important work. Titled after a line
from Knut Hamsuns Pan[5] (Cooper, Full of Life[6] 166), Ask the Dust opens
with what are perhaps Fantes most famous lines:

            One night I was sitting on the bed in my hotel room on Bunker
Hill, down
           in the very middle of Los Angeles. It was an important night in
      my life,
           because I had to make a decision about the hotel. Either I paid
           up or I got out: that was what the note said, the note the
           landlady had put under my door. A great problem, deserving acute
           attention. I solved it by turning out the lights and going to
           bed. (7)[7]

Fantes works have enjoyed a recent critical and popular resurgence[8], in
large part due to celebration of the author by later figures such as
Charles Bukowski[9] (who mentioned Fante[10] in novels, poems, and
interviews), as well as successful reissues from Black Sparrow Press.[11]
