One of the emblematic figures of the French AVANT-GARDE,  Claude  Cahun  was
born Lucy Rene Mathilde Schwab on 25 October 1894 in Nantes, the  niece  of
the modernist writer Marcel Schwob  and  daughter  of  Maurice  Schwob,  who
directed the journal Le Phare de la Loire. Educated in France  and  Britain,
she started publishing in the Mercure de France under the pseudonym  Claude
Courlis, then, from 1917, as Claude Cahun, a sexually ambivalent  pen  name
that reflected her provocative stance on gender identity.

Cahun first came to prominence in the 1920s when she settled with her  life-
long partner and stepsister, Suzanne Malherbe (pen name: Marcel  Moore),  in
Paris, and designed the costumes for The  Masked  Lady  (1924),  a  film  by
Viktor Turjansky (Abel Gances future assistant for Napoleon    1927).  She
then published a series of  texts  on  female  mythological  characters  and
artists (from Eve  to  Dalilah  and  Sappho),  entitled  Les  Hrones  (The
Heroines) in Mercure de France in 1925.  Although her  early  work  included
both fictional writing and photography,  she  is  best  remembered  for  her
series of photographic self-portraits which stage transexuality in a  manner
reminiscent of MARCEL DUCHAMPs cross-dressing  experiments  as  his  female
persona, Rrose Slavy (a pun on  Eros,  cest  la  vie  or  Eros,  thats
life). However, Cahuns highly  elaborate  play  on  double  images,  mirror
effects and constantly alternating gender roles predates DUCHAMPs  morphing
into the opposite sex in1921-22 by a decade.  As  early  as  1912-1913  she
started photographing herself wearing  stylized  or  caricaturally  gender-
coded  costumes  and  make-up   that   radically   subverted   conventional
perceptions  of  femininity.  These  images  confront  the  viewer  with   a
burlesque objectification of male desire in the  form  of  a  succession  of
characters or female  masks  that  properly  belong  in  the  circus,  the
pantomime or the puppet theatre. In 1928, Cahun joined the  theatre  company
Le Plateau, run by the AVANT-GARDE writer Pierre Albert-Birot, and acted  in
the play Blue Beard that Birot directed in  1929.  This  experience  can  be
said to have shaped her distinctive approach to photography as  a  means  of
exploring gender identity  through  carefully  staged  self-portraits  which
prefigure the work  of  contemporary  artists  such  as  Cindy  Sherman  and
Francesca Woodman.  Circumventing  the  sado-masochistic  innuendo  of  HANS
BELLMERs eroticised puppets, Cahuns impersonations of the  ingnue,  which
compete in her photographic works with a wide range of male  and  non-gender
specific personas, point to an unstable sexual  determination.  One  of  her
photomontages from Aveux non avenus [Inappropriate Confessions], a  book  of
essays  and  recorded  dreams  published  in  1930,  features  a  column  of
overlapping heads reduced to eyes or mouths in the manner of masks (cut  out
from her previous self-portraits), and carries the inscription: Under  this
mask another mask. I shall never finish strapping  away  all  these  faces.
Cahun was a member of the SURREALIST movement from 1932 when she joined  the
AEAR (The Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists)  and  met  ANDR
BRETON.

Having bought a farm in Jersey and settled there with her partner  in  1937,
Cahun  became  an  active  member  of  the  Resistance  during  the   German
Occupation (1940-1945). In 1944 she and Suzanne were arrested and  sentenced
to death, but the sentences were never carried  out.  Cahun's  health  never
fully recovered from her treatment in jail, and she died in 1954.  Her  work
has only been rediscovered over the past two decades,  and  since  1994  has
been made the object of several major exhibitions in Paris, London  and  New
York. During her lifetime,  Claude  Cahun  participated  in  the  Surrealist
Objects Exhibition in Paris and in the International  Surrealist  Exhibition
at the Burlington Galleries in London in 1936.
