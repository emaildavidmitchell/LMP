Laubser, Maggie (1886-1972)



The painter Maggie Laubser occupies an important space in South African art history. Her evolution as an artist was greatly influenced by her initial European academic training in South Africa and her later travels in Europe, which included London, Belgium, Italy and Germany. Laubser’s contact with the German Expressionists from 1922 to 1924 had the most profound impact on her artistic practice. The influence of German Expressionism was readily recognised in her paintings. But her naïve, apolitical and less than personal approach to the treatment of subjects in her painting exposed her to a critical and hostile audience at home in South Africa. In 1936, Laubser’s painting became more acceptable to a less conservative South African audience, and her paintings were included in the Large Empire Exhibition. Her inclusion in this exhibition also marked her entrance into the South African scene as an established artist. Throughout her prolific career, Laubser remained true to the rural South African landscape, in paintings of farmsteads, ducks and Cape Dutch architecture that spoke clearly of her rural and simple beginnings in the Boland.
