Bakusen, Tsuchida  (土田麦僊, 1887 - 1936) 



Tsuchida Bakusen was a Nihonga painter from the Kyoto Painting circle. He was also the leading founder of the Association for the Creation of National Painting (国画創作協会, Kokuga Sôsaku Kyôkai , 1918 – 1928). Bakusen moved to Kyoto in 1903 to study at Suzuki Shônen’s  art school (鈴木松年, 1848 – 1918), but later joined Takeuchi  Seihô’s school (竹内栖鳳, 1864 - 1942), where he thrived under Seihô’s tutelage and nurturing environment. In the years following his graduation from Kyoto Municipal Painting College, where he studied from 1909-1911, Bakusen produced Nihonga works such as Island Women (1912), influenced by French Post-Impressionists Gauguin, Van Gough and Cezanne. Bakusen exhibited at government-sponsored Bunten and Teiten exhibitions, but his dissatisfaction with the former led to a hiatus, during which he established the Association and exhibited only at its exhibitions, the Kokuten. Bakusen’s work is composed of figure paintings, mostly of women or children in rural landscapes. Bathhouse Maiden (1918) was declared an “important cultural property,” and Maiko in a Garden (1924) represents one of his great masterpieces.
