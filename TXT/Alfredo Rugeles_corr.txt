Rugeles, Alfredo (1949- )

Roberto Ojeda Tovar

The Venezuelan maestro ALFREDO RUGELES was born in Washington, DC, on 13
December 1949, while his parents were on diplomatic service. Composer,
conductor, lecturer, and pedagogue, 30 years at the podium give account
about this brilliant and varied career as an orchestra conductor. Artistic
Director of the Simon Bolivar Symphonic Orchestra since 1991, RUGELES is
frequently invited to conducting renowned ensembles throughout the world in
Germany, Spain, USA, Portugal, Holland, Italy, Ecuador, Colombia,
Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Cuba and
Uruguay.

Rugeless refined taste has led him to stand out as a recognized opera and
concert conductor, accompanying world-class soloists such as PAUL BADURA-
SKODA, MONTSERRAT CABALL, ALEXIS CRDENAS, CHICK COREA, ALIRIO DAZ,
MONIQUE DUPHIL, JANE EAGLEN, NATALIA GUTMAN, MAURICE HASSON, FRANS
HELMERSON, FRANOIS LE ROUX, AQUILES MACHADO, WYNTON MARSALIS, SHLOMO
MINTZ, GABRIELA MONTERO, JORGE LUIS PRATS, RUGGIERO RICCI, MSTISLAV
ROSTROPOVITCH, EDISON RUIZ, AND RENATA SCOTTO, among many others.

RUGELES has been appointed Musical Director of the Teresa Carreo Theatre
(1997-2000), Associate Conductor and Artistic Director of the Caracas
Municipal Symphonic Orchestra (1982-1987), founder and conductor of the
Nova Musica Ensemble, and Director of the Venezuelan Chamber Orchestra
Foundation. Since 2009, he conducts the Simon Bolivar Latin American
Ensemble of Contemporary Music which is devoted to diffusing and
interpreting the works of the universal present-day repertoire.

In 2000 RUGELES recorded his first CD as a conductor for the 70th
anniversary of the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra, along with the pianists
EDITH PEA and ARNALDO PIZZOLANTE. During 2002 and 2003 he recorded seven
other CDs with the same orchestra.

An acknowledged composer, his concise catalogue includes chamber, choral,
symphonic and electro acoustic works, worthy of national recognitions such
as the Caro de Boesi Composition Prize (1979) and the Municipal Music Prize
(1985) for his pieces SOMOSNUEVE, for chamber ensemble, and TANGUITIS, for
piano solo, respectively. RUGELESs music has been edited and recorded by
several labels, including Boosey and Hawkes, and performed all over Latin
America as well as in USA, Canada, Spain, Portugal, Austria, United
Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Greece, Romania and Hong Kong.

A founder and president, between 1999 and 2003, of the Venezuelan Society
for Contemporary Music, SVMC, in 1993 Rugeles was elected member of the
Executive Committee of the International Society for Contemporary Music,
ISCM, and then re-elected in 1995. His profound interest and devotion to
spreading the music of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, made him
organize until now 11 editions of the Latin American Music Festival,
which began in 1991. Several composers have dedicated their work to
Rugeles, including the Venezuelan composers DIANA ARISMENDI (1962- ),
JOSEFINA BENEDETTI (1953-), BEATRIZ BILBAO (1951-), INOCENTE CARREO (1919-
) and FEDERICO RUIZ (1948- ), and the Latin American composers MANUEL DE
ELAS (Mexico), GUIDO LPEZ GAVILN (Cuba), MARLOS NOBRE (Brazil), CARLOS
VZQUEZ (Puerto Rico) and ALBERTO VILLALPANDO (Bolivia).

RUGELES possesses a complete and varied musical background, which includes
diplomas in Voice and Choral Conducting as well as studies in Composition
with Yannis Ioannidis in Caracas, and in Composition and Orchestral
Conducting at the Robert Schumann Institute in Dsseldorf, under Gnther
Becker and Wolfgang Trommer, correspondingly. He has been also enlisted in
international conducting workshops with SERGIU CELIBIDACHE, MICHEL
TABACHNIK and FRANCO FERRARA.
