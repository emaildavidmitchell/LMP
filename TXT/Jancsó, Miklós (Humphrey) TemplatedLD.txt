Jancsó Miklós (1921-2014)

[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

Hungarian director Miklós Jancsó  (September 27, 1921-January 31, 2014) emerged in the 1960s with a series of films professing both an unapologetic Marxist perspective and a sub-textually resonant critique of Soviet-style totalitarianism.  His earliest films exhibited a palatable, even popular form of socialist realism, but his work departed from realist models after 1968; he developed a style involving extremely long takes (one of his features is comprised of only twelve shots), intricately choreographed crowd scenes, and pageant-like parables that at times depart notably from the confines of reality:  In Még kér a nép (1972) (Red Psalm) characters killed on screen are casually resurrected; in Szerelmem, Elektra (1974) (Electra, My Love) an anachronistic helicopter arrives in the final shot to carry its ancient Greek protagonists away to their destiny; and in any number of films, actors (often naked) and animals (usually horses) move in relation to each other in ballet-like synchronicity across vast outdoor plains.

Jancsó’s late-career features—vulgar, lowbrow comedies largely unseen outside the director’s homeland—are wholly different.  While widely popular in Hungary, they nevertheless contain trenchant political allegories offered in a national-popular style and merit attention.  Although his most distinctive work has often been derided as a ‘cinematic dead-end’ (Canby) by North American critics, many great filmmakers (Andrei Tarkovski,  Béla Tarr, Andrei Sokurov) and a number of major films (Novecento (1976) (1900) and Heaven’s Gate (1980), for example), are indebted to this artist.
