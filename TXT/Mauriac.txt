Franois Mauriac (1885-1970) was a French novelist, essayist, poet,
playwright and journalist. He was born in Bordeaux, France. He is best
known for depicting trenchant psychological dramas, and Christian
characters struggling with a modern world. His widowed mother raised him
with a stern, Catholic austerity that profoundly marked his literary works.
His stories are typically set in his native Bordeaux and the Landes
department in the Southwest of France.
In 1933, Mauriac was elected to the Acadmie Franaise. After receiving the
1952 Nobel Prize for Literature, he became a prominent polemical journalist
and he virulently denounced fascism. In 1958, he was awarded the Grand
Cross of the Lgion dhonneur. He became an official supporter of Charles
De Gaulle in 1962.
