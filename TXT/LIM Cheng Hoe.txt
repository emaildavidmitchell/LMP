LIM Cheng Hoe (1912– 1979)

Born in China, Lim Cheng Hoe moved to Singapore with his parents in 1919. Acknowledged as a noted early Singaporean artist, he showed artistic talent at an early age. In contrast to many of his contemporaries he embraced Western art aesthetics, influenced by his early art teacher, realist painter Richard Walker. Lim was greatly interested in painterly styles, and always strived to improve his own techniques. He is renowned for his excellent drawing skills, works in pastel, and watercolour. In 1969 he became a founding member of the Singapore Watercolour Society. His art practice was a passionate past time, his work and family taking precedence. Lim Cheng Hoe’s best-known paintings are of river scenes and he and a group of his contemporaries became known as the Singapore River Artists. Lim is also known as a portraitist. His artworks attract a strong following among collectors and are skilful renditions of Singaporean life, its people going about their daily routines and the natural world around them, as it straddled the transition from a traditional society to a modern one. Lim’s works are held in a number of institutional collections including the National Heritage Board Singapore and National University of Singapore Museum.
