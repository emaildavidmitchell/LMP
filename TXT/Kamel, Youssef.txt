Youssef Kamel is an Egyptian painter renowned for his impressionist
landscapes of the countryside and views of medieval Cairo. As one of the
leading figures of the pioneers (al-ruwwd), he was among the first
students to attend the newly founded School of Fine Arts in Cairo (1908),
together with artists Mahmoud Moukhtar and Ragheb Ayad. He studied under
the Italian painter Paolo Forcella and graduated in 1911. He worked as a
drawing teacher in secondary schools before receiving a scholarship in 1925
to pursue his studies at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Rome. On his
return to Egypt, in 1929, he was appointed professor at the School of Fine
Arts in Cairo, then becoming the head of its Painting Department in 1937.
Kamel also worked as a curator and directed the Museum of Egyptian Modern
Art from 1948 to 1949. He was named director of the School of Fine Arts in
Cairo between 1950 and 1953.
