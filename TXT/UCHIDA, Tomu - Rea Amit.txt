UCHIDA, Tomu (April 26, 1898-August 7, 1970) 

Uchida Tomu (born Uchida Tsunejirō) was a Japanese film director who had a long and prolific career that lasted for more than five decades. His body of work encompasses many films, of various genres and styles, including silent comedies, social dramas, detective films, and numerous jidaigeki, or period films. He began his career as an actor for both stage and film before taking a directorial position at Nikkatsu studios in the late 1920s. His 1939 film, Tsuchi (Earth), an innovative drama depicting lives of peasants, is considered a prewar realist masterpiece. In the last days of WWII, Uchida went to Manchuria, to work for the Manchukuo Film Association, but he stayed there even after the war, until 1953. A year later, in 1954, he was hired by Tōei, the most successful film studio of the time, for which, until his death in 1970, he directed numerous films, including acclaimed works such as Yōtō monogatari hana no Yoshiwara hyakuningiri (Killing in Yoshiwara, 1960) and Kiga kaigyō (A Fugitive from the Past, 1965). Although his films used a wide variety of different styles, many were centred around humanistic themes, and several also showcased experimentations with cinematic form.
