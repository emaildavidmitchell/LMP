Baudelaire, (Charles-Pierre) Charles (1821-1867)

Charles  Baudelaire  is  a  pivotal  figure  of  modernist  aesthetics.  His
contributions to poetry, the prose poem and criticism, as well as his  focus
on urban modernity and the psychological consequences of  industrialization,
have had an undeniable impact on modernism. He is amongst the first to  have
connected historical modernity to aesthetic modernity, in works such as  Les
Fleurs du mal, Spleen de Paris (Petits pomes en prose), and Le  Peintre  de
la vie moderne.

de Paris

Charles  Pierre  Baudelaire  was  born  1821  in  Paris  to  Joseph-Franois
Baudelaire and Caroline, ne Archembaut Defayis. His father  died  in  1827,
his mother married Jacques Aupick (a future general, ambassador and  senator
under the Empire), and he was sent to boarding school in 1828.  He  did  not
get along with Aupick. In the years 1839-41, he led a  life  of  dissipation
and literary bohemianism  in  the  Latin  Quarter  of  Paris.  He  became  a
disciple of Thophile Gautier. His family sent him on  voyage  to  the  East
Indies, but he went no further than the present day Runion  (Bourbon  Is.),
which inspired his writings on the sea and exoticism. On  his  return,  with
the help of his inheritance, he led the life of a dandy,  in  the  luxurious
Pimodan hotel. He began  a  lifelong  yet  troubled  relationship  with  the
multresse Jeanne Duval (Vnus Noire). This was a happy  period  in  which
he started to write some of the FLEURS DU MAL poems.   By  1844,  his  dandy
lifestyle threatened his inheritance, and his family imposed a  court  order
limiting him to 200 francs per month, leading him to live miserably.

1845 began his period of art criticism, with the Salon of  1845,  1846,  the
Exposition Universelle of 1855, and  the  Salon  of  1859.  In  1846-47,  he
discovered  the  works  of  EDGAR  ALLAN  POE  and  translates  POEs  Tales
(eventually published in  1855).  He  was  actively  involved  in  the  1848
Revolution. Greatly disappointed and disillusioned,  as  were  many  writers
and artists of his generation, he turned to literature. In the  years  1852-
55, he published poems in various reviews. After many years of  preparation,
the FLEURS DU MAL are published in  1857.  Accused  of  immorality  for  the
poems, he published a second edition with 35 new poems in 1861.

The years following the publication of the FLEURS (1857-64) are  accompanied
by constant illness, opium addiction, hashish overuse,  and  the  burden  of
debt, which forces him to produce a  lot  of  written  material.  He  exiled
himself to Belgium in 1864,  where  had  hopes  to  do  some  lecturing  and
negotiate the sale of his works. He did some  lectures,  but  floundered  in
Brussels, and wrote some POEMES EN PROSE. He suffered an aphasial attack  in
1866, which led to half paralysis, and was brought back to  Paris.  He  died
on August 31, 1867.







Baudelaire was part of the Parnasse, a movement that  anticipates  modernism
by  rejecting  the  Romantic  idea  of  the  self  in  favour  of   artistic
perfection,  exactness  of  expression,   transcendence   of   beauty,   the
prioritization of the power of words, and  the  rejection  of  stereotypical
language. Yet if the Parnasse was a rejection of ROMANTICISM,  it  was  also
its inheritor. The Parnasse contained at once an  aesthetic  of  autonomous,
free expression that came from Romanticism, and the drive  towards  rigorous
formalism of the Art for  Arts  Sake  movement  that  was  championed  by
Parnassian Thophile Gautier.

The FLEURS DU  MAL  manifests  an  artistic  formalism  that  simultaneously
evokes themes common to Romanticism: the ideal of beauty and escape  to  the
exotic on the one hand, and the morbid  gloom  of  melancholy  that  was  so
prevalent in the previous generation of writers  such  as  Vigny,  Lamartine
and Sainte-Beuve, on the other. With this book, in which  he  declares  that
he put all my thought, all my heart, all my religion (in disguise), all  of
my hate (letter to Ancelle, 1866), he attempts  to  create  a  pure  poetry
that can retrieve beauty from  evil.  This  no  longer  involves  the  usual
subjects of lyrical poetry (bucolic themes and  the  harmonies  of  nature),
but contrasting the ideal and exoticism with the grey morbidity of  the  new
urban realities of the industrial Nineteenth Century.  Many  other  dualisms
abound in this book, such as Satanism and mysticism, purity and  debauchery,
spleen and ideal, reverie and ennui. His  verse  evokes  sensations  through
correspondances between  sound  and  image  and  anticipates  RIMBAUD  and
MALLARM.

The  Petits  Pomes  en  prose,  or  Spleen  de  Paris,  are  very   similar
thematically to the FLEURS DU MAL, and are  a  pendant  to  these.   These
prose poems search for the new that preoccupied Baudelaire and  subsequent
Modernists like RIMBAUD. They attempt to escape the restriction of verse  in
order to reach for the lyrical movements of the soul,  the  undulations  of
reverie, the somersaults of conscience.

Baudelaire helped to define  the  modern  as  much  through  his  poetry  as
through his criticism.  He  wrote  numerous  essays  and  studies,  and  art
criticism. He announced innovators of  the  modern  like  Courbet,  Daumier,
Delacroix, Manet, and Poe.
