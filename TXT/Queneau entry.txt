Queneau, Raymond (19031976)

Raymond Queneau was a French novelist, poet and essayist of very broad
interests (leading to his directorship of the prestigious Encyclopdie de
la Pliade from 1959), but particularly associated with the formal
construction of his works, a linguistic ingenuity aimed at reducing the
gulf between colloquial and written language (a project which Queneau
referred to as le no-franais), and a sense humour drawing on the absurd.
Initially connected to the SURREALIST group of ANDR BRETON (18961966),
later with the Collge de 'Pataphysique founded in 1948 inspired by the
absurdist works of ALFRED JARRY (18731907), Queneau was in 1960 a founding
member of OuLiPo (a contraction of Ouvroir de littrature potentielle, or
Workshop of potential literature), an association of authors producing
works of literature governed by strict formal constraints. Queneaus Cent
mille milliards de pomes (One hundred million million poems, 1961), in
which the verses of ten sonnets can be combined to form a huge number of
poems, is characteristic of OuLiPo, but similar formal preoccupations can
be seen in Queneaus earlier works, such as his Exercises de style (1947),
in which a single short anecdote is told in ninety-nine different ways. His
most popular work, the 1959 novel Zazie dans le mtro, was made into a film
of the same name directed by Louis Malle in 1960.
