Frantiek Kupka, a Czech-born painter and graphic artist active in France,
was a pioneer of abstract painting. His Amorpha: Fugue in Two Colours,
shown at the Salon dAutumne in 1912, was the first manifestation of
abstract art in Paris. Vertical Schemes I (1912) exhibited at the Salon des
Indpendants in 1913 was later celebrated by Alfred H. Barr, founding
director of The Museum of Modern Art in New York, to be the first pure
geometrical abstraction. Guillaume Apollinaire appreciated Kupkas work and
included him in Orphism, but the artist was not fully accepted into avant-
garde circles, and despite his contact with the Puteaux Cubists, he refused
to be identified with them. Kupka understood motion and light as the only
forces that can penetrate and melt matter. From his viewpoint the spiritual
reality or cosmic order, which can be found in nature, is present in all
natural forms. While in the 1890s Kupka incorporated elements of symbolism,
naturalism and decorative stylisation into his works, starting in 1910, he
gradually began to liberate colour because of his belief in a deep
spiritual and cosmological meaning of art. This conceptual approach led him
to develop a scientific and theoretical basis for his work: he studied
optics and the colour theories from Isaac Newton to Michel-Eugne Chevreul
and also engaged in biology, physiology, anthropology and other fields,
subordinating these interests to his artistic concerns. Like Kandinsky and
Mondrian, Kupka was also influenced by anthroposophist ideas.

Kupka began his artistic training at the School of Arts and Crafts in
Jarom (now Czech Republic), he continued in the studio of religious
painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague (18871891), and later
attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (18921893). After settling in
Paris in 1896, Kupka earned a living by doing illustrations for various
periodicals; his first success came when he published the lithographic
series Money, Religion, Peace in the satirical weekly LAssiette au Beurre
between 1901 and 1904. (He unsuccessfully exhibited at the Socit
Nationalle de Beaux-Arts.) As is evident in his Piano Keys: The Lake
(1909), Kupka believed in a close analogy between visual art and musical
expression. His interest in cosmological themes and biological and
geological phenomena is reflected in his series Cosmic Spring  works
consisting of colourfully luminous shapes intertwined in a rotational
movement  on which he worked during the second decade of the twentieth
century. In the 1920s Kupka continued to use vertical and diagonal schemes;
his Vortex (1923) shows that he also experimented with circular movement,
the spiral and multiform rotation. In the second half of 1920s Kupka turned
to contemporary phenomena and began painting a series of canvases, among
them Comic Machine (192728), evoking jazz rhythm or steel machines. Being
dissatisfied with the results, he returned to pure abstraction at the
beginning of the 1930s. In contrast to his previous dynamic forms he
created simple harmonic and balanced compositions of lines, circles,
trapezoid or rectangular shapes while the colours were often reduced to red
and blue on a white background, e.g. Sun (1930). Kupka was a founding
member of the group Abstraction-Cration in 1931, which connected him with
the interwar avant-garde. During and after World War II his painting
activity decreased. In 1946 he presented his paintings at the first Salon
des Ralits Nouvelles in Paris, where he then exhibited regularly until
his death. A re-evaluation of his lifes work and recognition of his
importance for the history of modern art did not come until his posthumous
exhibition in Paris in 1958.
