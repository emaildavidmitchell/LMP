Antunes, Jorge (1942- )
Gerson Valle

JORGE ANTUNES, who was born in Rio de Janeiro on April 23, 1942, and is  one
of Brazils most active vanguard musicians, is fond of observing that  life
imitates art, thus demonstrating his combativeness as  an  artist.  Trained
in violin, composition, and conducting, as well as  in  physics,  he  became
the first composer of electroacoustic music in Brazil in the decade  of  the
sixties, when he wrote about the relationships between sound and  color,  in
addition to exhibiting multimedia works in galleries. In  1971  he  won  the
Angelicum di Milano prize for  his  composition  Isomerism,  edited  by  the
Edizioni Suvini Zerboni. Following this prize he  received  various  others.
His pieces, which, including the use of conventional  instruments  and  even
the symphony orchestra, were part of  the  radical  vanguard  of  the  time,
gradually evolved to incorporate the values of a  technique  with  roots  in
his traditional education. Always in a revolutionary manner,  along  with  a
humanistic concern, which took on political meanings in vigorous works  such
as  PROUDHONIA,  VIOLET  ELEGY  FOR  MONSIGNOR  ROMERO  (JUSTICE  CANT   BE
KILLED!), the opera OLGA, the CANTATA OF THE  TEN  PEOPLES,  the  AUTOMOBILE
CLAXON SYMPHONY, etc. Together with his political participation in  society,
his aesthetic concern, by virtue of being professor  at  the  University  of
Braslia, has led him to compose works in search of  sound  renovations  and
more immediate sound relations as phenomena pertaining to physics.
      The decade of the sixties  witnessed  the  creation  of  the  SIDEREAL
WALTZ, the  LUMINOUS FLUX FOR WHITE SOUNDS, the  POPULORUM  PROGRESSIO  MASS
(written for his wedding with Mariuga Lisba Antunes in 1969),  DISSOLUTION,
ACUSMORFOSE, etc.
      Next came studies abroad. First in  Buenos  Aires,  at  the  Instituto
Torcuato di Tella, where Alberto Ginastera was a  major  stimulus,  then  in
Utrecht in  the  Netherlands.  After  that  he  studied  at  the  Groupe  de
Recherches  Musicales  in  Paris  and  completed  his  masters  degree  and
doctorate at the Sorbonne.  His  doctoral  dissertation  was  entitled  New
sound, new notation. During this period of studies (between 1970 and  1973)
he composed radical works  like  POETICA,  BARTOKOLLAGIA  MCMLXX,  TARTINIA,
CROMOFONTICA, SELF-PORTRAIT ON A BUENOS AIRES LANDSCAPE,  MUSIC  FOR  EIGHT
PERSONS PLAYING THINGS, PROUDHONIA, etc. From 1974 to 1979  live-electronics
predominated, with traditional instruments processed in  real  time.  During
this period the symphonic works came to acquire a sonority similar  to  that
of electronic music. Works from this phase include: CONCERTO FOR A MONTH  OF
SUN, SOURCE, VIVALDIA MCMLXXV, TRIO IN  L  PIS,  ULTRA-VIOLET  CATASTROPHE,
IDOSYNCHRONIE, etc.
      Since 1973 he has been a professor of composition at the  Universidade
de Braslia. He has always traveled widely,  as  a  result  of  his  theses,
awards in prize competitions, commissioned works, and with the  Universidade
de Braslia Musical Experimentation Group (GeMUnB),  which  he  founded  and
has led from the start. Residence  in  Braslia,  the  center  of  political
power in Brazil, whetted his politically dissident facet. Beginning in  1980
he joined parties on the left and for a while belonged to the  Green  Party,
when his anarchism was enhanced by ecological militancy. Such a  vision  led
him to adopt natural laws  in  music,  such  as  the  harmonic  series,  the
resulting sounds, and acoustical harmony. Between 1980  and  1990  his  most
noteworthy compositions are VIOLET ELEGY FOR MONSIGNOR  ROMERO,  THE  SINGLE
NOTE KING (a mini-opera for children for which he wrote the libretto),  Four
short pieces from the people (for  mixed  chorus),  the  opera  QORPO  SANTO
(with a libretto he wrote and which  debuted  in  the  National  Theater  of
Braslia in 1983), the opera OLGA (composed between 1985 and  1995,  with  a
libretto by Gerson Valle, and first performed during the 2006 season of  the
So Paulo Municipal Theater), CONTEXT-WITHOUT-KING, etc.
      Participation in Brazilian political life, when the country was  still
under military rule, caused Antunes to join a demonstration in  Braslia  to
demand direct popular  vote  for  the  election  of  the  president  of  the
Republic. At this demonstration, which was attended  by  some  of  the  most
important figures of the political opposition, such as the future  president
Lula, he presented the SYMPHONY OF THE  DIRECT  VOTE  (or  SYMPHONY  OF  THE
AUTOMOBILE CLAXONS) on June 1, 1984. Perched on a platform, Jorge  conducted
motorists lined up in a large parking lot in which each row had horns  of  a
specific musical note, with a background chorus intoning a text  written  by
Tet Catalo. His political  streak  had  already  been  manifested  in  his
VIOLET ELEGY FOR MONSIGNOR ROMERO, subtitled  JUSTICE  CANT  BE  KILLED,  a
phrase pronounced by the cleric himself who was assassinated  for  defending
better conditions for the poor in  El  Salvador.  This  piece,  written  for
symphony orchestra and childrens chorus when he was a guest composer  in  a
kibbutz  in  Israel,  debuted  at  the  SIMC  Festival  in   the   Beersheba
Conservatory on July 3, 1980.
      To commemorate the five hundredth  anniversary  of  the  discovery  of
Brazil,  Antunes  prepared  an  oratory  which  was  not   laudatory,   but,
consistent with his utopian anarquistic view (in  the  sense  of  struggling
for better conditions in the world), presents the  conciliatory  reality  of
the Portuguese language,  claiming  space  for  all  the  peoples  who  were
colonized by Portugal. The CANTATA OF THE TEN PEOPLES, for large  orchestra,
mixed chorus, electronic sounds, narrator, actors, and  solo  singers,  with
texts drawn from the Portuguese chroniclers and poets  from  the  ten  lands
considered, debuted in the National Theater in Braslia on April 27, 1999.
      The musical line of this cantata follows that achieved  in  the  opera
OLGA,  in  which  electroacoustic  music  coexists  with  symphonic   music,
atonalism  with  tonal  melodies,  and  a  series   of   twentieth   century
revolutionary tendencies with knowledge from his university  education.  The
multimedia artist appears  here  with  the  multiple  perspective  of  post-
modernity. And  the  revolutionary  recounts  the  story  of  the  Brazilian
Communist leader,  Luiz  Carlos  Prestes,  who,  with  his  companion,  Olga
Benario, lived undercover in Brazil in 1935, testing  the  possibilities  of
revolution, until they were  both  arrested  and  she,  a  German  Jew,  was
deported to Germany, where she died  in  a  concentration  camp  (the  final
scene of the opera).
      One could  say  that,  beginning  in  1991,  Jorge  Antunes  has  been
undergoing a  process  of  revisionism  and  eclecticism  in  his  aesthetic
concepts. Among other pieces he composed: BALLADE DURE, MIR  ESCUCH  MIR,
KLARINETTENQUINTETT, THE BLUE BUTTERFLY (a mini-opera  with  a  libretto  he
authored), VIOLET RITUAL, EOLIOLINDA, etc. In 2011,  based  on  research  in
medieval music and theater, he wrote the libretto and music for the AUTO  OF
DON BOSCOS NIGHTMARE, an opera which he called a  street  opera,  presented
in the squares of Braslia  and  the  surrounding  region,  questioning  the
hardly ethical behavior of many Brazilian  politicians,  whose  stories  are
told  in  a  burlesque  manner  with  a  severe  criticism  of  the  system.
Continuing the presentations in 2012, with each new political scandal a  new
character is added.
