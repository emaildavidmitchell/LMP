MNILMONTANT (1925)

Mnilmontant is a  38  minutes  black  and  white  avant-garde  French  film
directed by Dimitri Kirsanoff. Its narrative develops solely through  images
and montage, without the support  of  sound  or  title  cards.  Mnilmontant
tells the story of two young sisters who leave their  country  home  in  the
wake of their parents brutal murder, and settle  in  the  eponymous  working
class Parisian neighborhood where they fall prey to the  ruthless  seduction
of a young man. The film is notable for its  use  of  double  exposure,  the
depiction of disorienting urban landscapes via very rapid cutting,  as  well
as for the brutality of  the  opening  and  closing  scenes.  Mnilmontants
enigmatic narrative and frenzied, anguished atmosphere leave the  motivation
of the characters obscure. Richard Prouty (1996) interprets the  film  as  a
critique of the escapist mainstream melodramas popular during the  20s.  But
Kirsanoff argues that the film  focuses  on  the  assaultive  experience  of
urban life that fragments both psyche and experience.  So,  Mnilmontant  is
a  film  about  desire,  not  pleasure  (14)  in  which  the   traumatized
characters seek unsuccessfully to regain  a  lost  sense  of  innocence  and
completion.
