The successor to the World of Art, the Symbolist art-literary journal The Golden Fleece  (Zolotoe runo, 1906-1909), was published in Moscow by the offspring of the wealthy merchant family, Nikolai Riabushinsky (1877-1951), and ran for 48 issues. It became a rival to the literary periodical The Scales (Vesy, 1904-1909), edited by Symbolist poet Valery Briusov (1873-1924). The quest implied in the title and expressed in the editorial manifesto was an articulation of the Symbolist notion of the search for beauty and the value of art. Contemporaries, however, criticized the journal and believed that it did not express anything new or fresh. For the first six months it was published in Russian and French articulating the cosmopolitan desire to promote Russian art and literature in Europe. The Symbolist artists of the future art group Blue Rose (Golubaia roza, organized in 1907) created the look of The Golden Fleece. The periodical printed the highest quality reproductions and used expensive imported enameled and silk paper. By 1909, the journal gradually lost its luxurious look and ceased publication after Riabushinskii’s bankruptcy.
