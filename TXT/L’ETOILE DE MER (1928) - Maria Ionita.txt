LTOILE DE MER (1928)

Ltoile de mer (The Starfish) is a 16-minute black and  white  silent  film
directed by Man Ray. It is based on a poem, later developed into  a  script,
by Robert Desnos.  The  film  tells,  in  a  highly  oblique,  hallucinatory
manner, the tale of a  slowly  disintegrating  relationship  between  a  man
(Andr de la Rivire) and a woman  (Alice  Kiki  Prin).  On  title  cards,
Desnos words provide a running lyrical commentary (Women's teeth are  such
charming things). The title Starfish appears  throughout  the  film  as  an
objective correlative of  desire,  memory  and  loss.  Ltoile  de  mer  is
notable for its Surrealist, poetic images and for  Rays  innovative  camera
technique: a good deal of the film is shot through gelatin filters or  thick
panes of glass which lend  it  an  underwater,  funereal  feel.  The  films
fundamental ambiguity lends itself to multiple interpretations. It has  been
read as vaguely autobiographic,  an  expression  of  Ray  and  Alice  Prins
impending separation. An alternate interpretation focuses  on  the  presence
of alchemic symbols dear to the Surrealists, like the  tower,  the  star  or
the athanoric fire; Ltoile de mer thus  becomes  the  story  of  a  mystic
quest and union.
