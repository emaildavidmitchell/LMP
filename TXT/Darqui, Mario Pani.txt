The Mexican  architect,  Mario  Pani,  spent  his  formative  years  between
Belgium, Italy and France  due  to  his  fathers  diplomatic  posts.  After
graduating from the coles des Beaux-Arts  (1934),  he  returned  to  Mexico
just before a period of massive urban transformation in Mexico City.  During
his first decades in  Mexico,  Pani  worked  intensively  to  establish  his
career. In very little time, he began  to  win  his  first  commissions.  Of
those early years the most  important  was  perhaps  Hotel  Reforma  (1936),
which Pani controversially took over from Carlos Obregn  Santalicia.  Apart
from this, his early career in Mexico  saw  him  actively  participating  in
many competitions against the most renowned architects of his time. In  1938
he  founded  the  magazine  Arquitectura/Mxico  (1938-1979)  not  only   to
disseminate contemporary architecture in  Mexico,  but  also,  to  republish
material from international magazines.

Over the course of his career, Pani designed  a  huge  variety  of  projects
ranging from educational buildings, such as  the  National  Conservatory  of
Music (1946), the National School of Teachers (1947) or his  famous  Rectory
Building in Mexico City (1952); touristic complexes  such  as  the  Acapulco
Yacht  Club  (1955);  administrative  centres  like  Condominio   Acero   in
Monterrey (1959) and urban plans  such  as  the  Medical  Center  Masterplan
(with Jose Villagran Garcia, 1942), the University Campus  of  the  National
Autonomous University (with Enrique del Moral,  1952),  among  many  others.
Yet, Mario Pani is more commonly remembered for his housing projects.

Following  the  Mexican  Revolution,  Mexico  city  began   experiencing   a
population explosion and  many  were  living  in  precarious  conditions.  A
general housing shortage had become a broad concern for the city,  and  Pani
was determined to take action in such  a  problem  at  an  urban  scale.  He
impatiently commented, we must build  for  all  Plan!  Build!  Plan  well!
Build now![1] With this enthusiasm, and influenced by Le Corbusiers  Ville
Contemporaine (1922) and Ville Radieuse (1924),  Pani  began  promoting  for
the first time in Mexico City high density housing projects in  response  to
Mexico Citys urgent social  needs.  During  his  life  Pani  designed  over
300,000 apartments  in  Mexico.  His  first  large  scale  project  was  the
Multifamiliar  Presidente  Miguel   Aleman,   a   housing   development   of
approximately 1000 housing units. It was the first large  scale  project  in
Mexico following modernist principles. Yet, perhaps  his  largest  and  most
memorable built endeavour was the Habitational  City  of  Nonoalco-Tlateloco
(1966). This development was designed  as  a  vertical  city  on  198  acres
located  just  outside  the  city  centre.  It  was  to  house  about  70000
inhabitants and was organised in 101 buildings  together  with  the  iconic,
triangular profile administration building topped by a belfry. This  project
is controversial to  this  date  for  lacking  social  cohesion  and  Panis
conscious avoidance of the cultural and historical importance of the site.

While a great majority of his work is still in use,  much  of  it  has  been
heavily  damaged  or  destroyed  by  historical  events.  His   project   in
Tlatelololco was the site of a student massacre in 1968 and heavily  damaged
by the 1985 earthquake in  Mexico  City.  Other  projects  such  as,  Centro
Urbano Presidente Juarez (1952), a housing development  of  25000  sqm,  was
also partially demolished following the earthquake. In spite  of  this,  his
work is widely appreciated. Among many awards, he was  a  recipient  of  the
National Prize for Arts of 1986.
