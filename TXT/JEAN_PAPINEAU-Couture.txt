JEAN PAPINEAU-COUTURE

Paul Bazin

	

	The catalog of Jean Papineau-Couture (1916-2000) includes many stylistically diverse works. His music evolved throughout his life, moving from a form of neo-classicism most probably influenced by the composer’s many encounters with Igor Stravinsky, to an atonal idiom. Papineau-Couture composed many concertante-style works, as witnessed by his Clair-obscure (1986), a double concerto for contrabassoon, double bass and orchestra. The composer also wrote many pieces of chamber music, most often for soloist and piano accompaniment (Caprices, 1962; Discussion animée, 1997), as well as a substantial amount of orchestral works.
