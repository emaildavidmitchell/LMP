PAGE OF MADNESS, A (1926)



A Page of Madness (Kurutta ichipeiji or ippeiji) is a black-and-white silent Japanese film directed by Kinugasa Teinosuke that has been celebrated for its experimental use of cinematic form. Kinugasa was assisted by members of the Shinkankakuha (New Impressionist School), a literary group that explored the new sensations of modernity. Kawabata Yasunari helped write the story, but the film was eventually made with additions by Kinugasa, Inuzuka Minoru, and Sawada Banko. The narrative features an old man who works as custodian of a mental institution where his wife has been admitted. When their daughter announces her impending marriage, the man experiences a series of delusions about her and his wife. Depicting these moments, Kinugasa used rapid cutting, optical distortions, double exposures, mobile framing and other devices influenced by French Impressionist film and German Expressionism, but achieved a level of experiment that to some surpassed any film made at that time. The film was released without intertitles but with a benshi narration in 1926 and spurred debates about its cinematic form and melodramatic story. The film was considered lost until Kinugasa discovered a print in 1971. It was re-released, but in a version a fourth shorter than the original.

Paratextual materials:

I can provide some frame grabs. Clips would be hard because the National Film Center in Japan still claims rights over the film.
