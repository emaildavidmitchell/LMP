Fournier, Henri Alban (18861914)
Henri Alban Fournier, writing under the pseudonym Alain-Fournier, was a
French novelist most famous for writing the literary classic, Le Grand
Meaulnes (1913). The title often appears in the original French but has
also been translated as The Lost Estate, The Wanderer, and The Lost Domain.
Fourniers promising literary career was cut short by his untimely death in
1914 while fighting for France in the Meuse during World War I. Le Grand
Meaulnes features a teenage male protagonist struggling with the transition
from childhood to adolescence and shares similarities with events in
Fourniers young life. It is thus closely associated with Fourniers life
story and tragic death at the young age of twenty-seven. Le Grand Meaulnes
is equally celebrated for its innovation in literary style and narrative.
The novel demonstrates characteristics of the Symbolist movement in
literature as a lyrical study of the French countryside. And Fournier
recounts his fantastic adventure story as a medieval allegory. Fournier is
additionally known for his poetry and writings as a literary reviewer. In
1924 French writer Jacques Rivire published a collection of these works
under the title Miracles. His extensive correspondence with Rivire has
become part of French literary criticism.
