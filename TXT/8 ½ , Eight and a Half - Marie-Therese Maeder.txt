8 ½ , Eight and a Half (Otto e mezzo, IT, 1963)



A semi-autobiographical film made up of a series of episodes, Federico Fellini’s 8 ½ problematizes modern ideas of authorship (Kovács 2007). 8 ½ extended the Italian filmmaker’s existing international reputation as a director, becoming his third film to win the Academy Award for “Best Foreign Language Film”. 8 ½ scrutinizes the troubled state of mind of a director during the creative process of filmmaking (Stubbs 2006). The central character is Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), a middle-aged film director who has lost the inspiration that will enable him to finish his film. In creative crisis, Anselmi withdraws to a sanatorium where he meets his film collaborators. His private and professional entourage is highly demanding. At the end of the film, during a meeting with journalists, Anselmi hides under a table and shoots himself. Anselmi, Fellini’s alter ego, is omnipresent, with his first-person narration based on dreams, imaginings and memories that reference Fellini’s commitment to Jungian psychology. 8 ½ portrays its subject’s self-seeking attempt to form a continuous narrative of his life; equally modern is the protagonist’s search for authenticity and individual truth within a context shaped by tradition and public opinion (Pamerleau, 2009). In engaging the concept of the cinéma d’auteurs, the film perfectly portrays the spirit of the early Sixties. 8 ½ is not only a tale of filmmaking but also a reflection on cinema’s cultural significance.
