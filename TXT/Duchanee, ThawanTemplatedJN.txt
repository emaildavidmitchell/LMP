[Enter any variant forms of your headword – OPTIONAL]

Thawan Duchanee, a National Artist from the year 2001, is one of the best-known artists in Thailand, both for people in the art scene and the general public. He first gained recognition in 1967 with the exhibition of his early series of paintings, in which he represented spiritualized power by drawing from a combination of various forms of idealised Thai beliefs and images from his own imagination. The work is beautiful and complex but is easily understood by audiences at an international level. Tawan’s most famous artworks often consist of human and animal forms, which are inspired by Buddhism, Eastern philosophy, and Thai literature. With his excellent knowledge of anatomy, Tawan has designed various beautiful figures that are full of imagination and emotion. Some are depicted with strong muscles in variety of aggressive actions, while some are created to represent feelings of calm and peacefulness. Violent expression is often mixed with graceful and complicated patterns created in the volumes of light and shadow. Most of Tawan’s enormous artworks use black and white tones with perhaps a few colors inserted in them. The movements of characters cover the entire canvas. Some his artworks are quickly and skillfully painted, mimicking the brushwork of Chinese painting, while some are elegantly created by small lines of ballpoint pens.

Thawan graduated with a bachelor degree in Fine Arts from the Faculty of Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Arts, Silpakorn University and continued his education at the art institute in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At present, he retains a lot of influence on the younger generation of artists, his works mostly focusing on an exploration of Eastern spirituality, natural inspirations and imaginings related to his belief in Eastern philosophy.  Thawan developed his unique style from the detailed and complicated patterns of Thai traditional art. Under the structure of anatomy, strong contrast of light and shadow, the artwork appears as the mixture of reality and supernatural ideal beauty.
