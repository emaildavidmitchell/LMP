DOVE, ARTHUR                                             Word Count: 533

Arthur Dove (1880-1946) was a pioneer of abstraction and probably the first
American to create purely non-representational paintings.  His interest in
natural forces, processes and forms inspired most of his work.  His use of
nature epitomises a broad trend in early American modernist painting that
includes many artists in the Alfred Stieglitz circle. Dove came from the
Finger Lakes region of New York. He studied at Hobart College and Cornell
University, and graduated from the latter in 1903. He was always deeply
fascinated by nature and analysed it carefully. After college, Dove earned
a living by producing commercial illustrations and operating farms in
Connecticut. He traveled after college and studied European modernism, as
Still Life with Lobster (1908) demonstrates. Doves breakthrough to
abstraction occurred around 1910 and continued for about four years in
numerous small works done with charcoal and pastel on paper. Doves early
works became notorious when many of them were exhibited in 1912 at Alfred
Stieglitzs gallery 291 and the Thurber Gallery in Chicago.  Their
notoriety later earned some of them the provocative title of the Ten
Commandments.

Doves early abstractions are muted or monochromic in colour. These works
include Abstractions No. 1 to No. 6, Nature Symbolized No. 1 to No. 3,
Plant Forms and Movement No. 1.  Although a few feature architectural and
landscape imagery, most are based on plants, flowers, leaves, trees, wind,
rain and other natural forms and processes and are highly abstracted. In
the early-1920s, Dove resumed painting after several years during which
financial and family obligations kept him from art. At this time he began
working on a larger scale using oils, sometimes mixed with wax emulsions,
and worked on various surfaces, including canvas, sheet metal, and tin.
These unusual mixtures and surfaces allowed intriguing textural effects for
visualizing natural forms and phenomena. By now his interests expanded to
include birds, moving water, clouds, the moon, the sun, stars, and
synaesthetic experiences of colour, light, and sounds. He developed various
pictorial devices to suggest growth, movement and energy, such as using
rhythmic force lines surrounding forms similar to those used by the
Futurists. Among his best works from the early-1920s until his death are
Fog Horns (1929), Green and PurpleSeagull Motif (1929), A Field of Grain
as Seen from a Train (1931), Rain or Snow (1944) and That Red One (1944).
Dove actively painted until he died in 1946. He was romantically involved
with the artist Helen Torr from 1920 until his death, and they were married
in 1932. Financial success eluded him during his lifetime although he was
strongly supported and promoted by Alfred Stieglitz.
