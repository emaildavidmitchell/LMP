Sakakura, Junzo (1901-69)



Sakakura was born in Gifu Prefecture but lived primarily in Tokyo, where he would set up a practice in 1940. Studies in Art History at the Tokyo Imperial University (1923-27) were followed with a two-year course in construction that prepared him for a career in LE CORBUSIER’s Paris atelier that lasted over five years. He would visit Paris again in 1937 for the fifth meeting of the International Congress for Modern Architecture (CIAM), and to design the prize-winning Japanese Pavilion for that year’s International Exposition. With his country at war, and little resources available at home, he committed himself to research on prefabrication in housing, and designed a residential plan for a Manchurian town in 1940. Influenced by JEAN PROUVÉ, he operated the National Institution for the Wartime Construction of Prefabricated Architecture between 1942 and 1945. His first major commission, realized in 1951, was Kamakura’s Museum of Modern Art. This is a Corbusian prism raised over a pond on stilts, evidencing respect for tradition – something his Bamboo Chair (1949) had already demonstrated. From the late 1950s he would design a number of projects for town halls, train stations and urban plazas. Involvement with the Milan Triennale, as director of its Japanese sections in 1957 and 1960, and consultation on site planning for Osaka’s Expo ‘70 just before his death, would secure his reputation as one of the giants of architectural modernism in Japan.
