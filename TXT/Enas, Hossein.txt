Enas, Hoessein (1924- 1995)

Mohd. Hoessein Enas was born in Bogor Indonesia, migrated to Singapore in
1945, and finally became a citizen of the Federation of Malaya in 1956. He
was largely self-taught and is famous for using acrylic and oil paint to
portray his subjects in the style European academic portraiture. In 1956,
he spearheaded the Majlis Kesenian Melayu (Malaysian Arts Council) and was
the founder and the first president of Angkatan Pelukis Semenanjung (APS,
The Peninsular Artists Force). He played a distinct role in Malaysian art
by introducing modernity and Western art through his European academic
figurative drawings. Under Enas, the APS promoted the idea that local
painters should produce artwork that stemmed from their emotional
identification with Malaya by depicting the Malay ideal of beauty and
character. Enas is widely acclaimed as the Father of Malaysian portrait
painting and was appointed "Royal Portrait Painter, to the Sultan of
Selangor in 1990. His later works include portraits of several Sultans and
members of Malaysian royalty.  Enas was a member of Fellow Royal Society of
Arts, London and was also the Head of Design and Staging Services, at Radio
and Television Malaysia.
