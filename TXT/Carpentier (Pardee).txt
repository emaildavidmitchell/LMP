Carpentier (y Valmont), Alejo (1904-1980)

Alejo Carpentier, Cuban novelist and musicologist, formed important
connections between European and Latin American modernist literature of the
twentieth century. He was a founder of the avant-garde Afro-Cuban movement,
incorporating African heritage into Cuban art, theatre, and music. Exiled
in France from 1929-1939 for political dissent, he associated with
Surrealists and was for a time heavily influenced by their work. In France,
he finished the novel he had started in a Cuban prison: Ecue-Yamba-O!
[Praised Be God!] (1933). After returning to Cuba, a trip to Haiti inspired
his novel, El reino de este mundo [The Kingdom of this World] (1948), an
imaginative recreation of the Haitian revolution and its aftermath. In his
prologue to this novel, he introduced the term lo real maravilloso
Americano, or magical realism, as it was later known. He distinguished
between the Surrealism of Europe and the magical realism of Latin America
by insisting that a heightened description of Latin American reality could
effectively produce the uncanny effects achieved by Surrealists with more
artificial techniques. Exiled again to Venezuela in 1945, he produced Los
pasos perditos [The Lost Steps] (1953), which reveals the inadequacy of
modernist conceptions of the primitive.  He returned to Cuba in 1959 after
Castros revolution, which he supported and made the subject of his final
novel, La consagracin de la primavera [The Consecration of Spring] (1979).
In the historical epic novel El siglo del las luces [Explosion in a
Cathedral] (1962), Carpentier demonstrates the influence of the European
Enlightenment in the American world. His novel El Arpa y la Sombra [The
Harp and the Shadow] (1979), is an imagined account of Christopher
Columbuss final confessions in the context of a proposal to canonize him
in the nineteenth century. Emphasizing Columbuss abduction of Native
Americans and his thwarted plan to enslave them, it was influential in the
late-twentieth-century movement to refocus the story of the conquest on the
indigenous people Columbus disregarded and displaced. Carpentiers
celebration of the energetic, sumptuous Baroque style and critical
elucidation of magical realism influenced the Latin American Boom
generation of writers, including Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Carlos Fuentes.
His combination of experimental European literary style with distinctively
Latin American subjects and sensibility provided a useful critique and a
new direction for modernist literature.
