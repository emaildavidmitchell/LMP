Dos Passos, John (1896-1970)

John Dos Passos was an American writer who is best known for his
contemporary chronicles of American life. His early novels, including
Manhattan Transfer (1925) and the U.S.A. trilogy  The 42nd Parallel
(1930), Nineteen Nineteen (1932), and The Big Money (1936)  are considered
classics of American MODERNISM, offering a complex and multifaceted
portrayal of American society from the turn of the century to the Great
Depression. The depiction of urban experience in these novels reflects the
cinematic montage of DZIGA VERTOV, the STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS style of
JAMES JOYCE, and the dynamism and simultaneity of Italian FUTURISM, among
other influences. In addition to writing fiction, Dos Passos was a
dramatist, poet, historian, journalist, travel writer, painter, and
translator. His first two novels, One Mans Initiation: 1917 (1920) and
Three Soldiers (1921), are harrowing and highly critical accounts based on
his experience as an ambulance driver in the FIRST WORLD WAR. He published
a collection of free verse, A Pushcart at the Curb (1922), as well as
translations of the modernist poetry of BLAISE CENDRARS. In the late 1920s
he worked briefly as a director, playwright, and set designer at the
VSEVOLOD MEYERHOLD-inspired New Playwrights Theater in Greenwich Village,
where his associates included communist writers like Mike Gold and John
Howard Lawson.
      Although he was in many ways a transatlantic figure, spending much of
his youth abroad and travelling constantly throughout his life, Dos
Passoss novels are primarily concerned with American identity, history,
and society. He wanted his novels to be more than just stories: they were a
kind of reportage, tracing the rapid economic and social changes seen in
America during his lifetime. Narrated from a detached, even mechanical
perspective, the novels always depict the struggle between the individual
and the system, whether that system is the war machine, corporate
capitalism, or (in later years) the Communist Party. The vision of America
in his greatest work, U.S.A., is composed of four principal interlocking
styles: Newsreels, which include newspaper headlines, popular song
lyrics, and advertising jargon; Camera Eye sections, offering subjective,
stream-of-consciousness memories; biographical sketches of important
figures in history (Woodrow Wilson, Henry Ford, the Wright Brothers); and
fictional narratives that follow twelve characters whose paths occasionally
cross, following the six degrees logic that Dos Passos also employed in
Manhattan Transfer. The numerous fragments of U.S.A. are sorted into these
four streams, not unlike automobile parts in a Ford factory on parallel
assembly lines. Eventually they come together to form a whole, a totalizing
vision of the nation: albeit a nation divided into haves and have-nots, the
powerful and the powerless.
      Dos Passoss success placed him in the company of other LOST
GENERATION writers such as ERNEST HEMINGWAY, F. SCOTT FITZGERALD, and
WILLIAM FAULKNER. At his peak in 1936, the year that saw the publication of
the last volume of U.S.A. (The Big Money), he appeared on the cover of Time
magazine. But his critical reputation declined sharply after the SECOND
WORLD WAR, partly due to his shift away from the radical leftist politics
that had to a large extent defined his career. The decisive break came in
1937, when his friend and translator, Jos Robles, was murdered by Soviet
agents during the Spanish Civil War. The dramatic event, which caused a
permanent rift in the longstanding friendship between Dos Passos and
HEMINGWAY (both of whom were in Spain at the time), led Dos Passos to
abandon the cause to which he had been so dedicated in the 1920s and 1930s.
In later years he became an increasingly outspoken opponent of Communism
and a supporter of American conservatives like Joseph McCarthy and Richard
Nixon. In 1968, two years before his death, he looked back on his career as
part of the Paris Reviews Writers at Work interview series:
