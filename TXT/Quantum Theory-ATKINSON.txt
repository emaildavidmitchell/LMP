Quantum Theory
Developed in the early twentieth century, quantum theory is a branch of
theoretical physics that concerns the unpredictable quality of particles at
the quantum, or subatomic, level. In 1900, Max Planck (1859-1947)
inaugurated inquiry into quantum mechanics when he challenged the classical
theory that light behaves as a wave, proposing instead that it is emitted
in quanta, or discrete units. This ground-breaking theory was more clearly
articulated by 1927, in Niels Bohrs (1885-1962) Principle of
Complementarity and Werner Heisenbergs (1901-1976) Uncertainty
Principle. Heisenberg proposed that all physical phenomena that can be
observed are subject to a degree of indeterminacy and suggested that the
act of scientific observation of a quantum system would change that system.
These new proposals of quantum theory unseated the authority of classical
deterministic physics and challenged the perceived objectivity of science.
Attracted by quantum theorys revolutionary ideas, various modernist
critics adapted its principles of uncertainty and indeterminacy to studies
in the humanities. For instance, I. A. Richards (1893-1970) and William
Empson (1906-1984) employed Bohrs concepts in their work on irony,
ambiguity and paradox. Heisenberg suggested, however, that both modern
artistic innovations and quantum theory were the products of profound
transformations in the fundamentals of our existence (95).
