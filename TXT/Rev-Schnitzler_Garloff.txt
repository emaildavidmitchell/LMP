Schnitzler, Arthur (1862-1931)

Arthur Schnitzler was a leading exponent of Viennese modernism. The son of
a Jewish laryngologist, Schnitzler studied and practiced medicine before
devoting himself exclusively to writing.  His literary works explore the
themes of love and death, reality and illusion, and changing codes of honor
and morality.  In his dramatic plays, Schnitzler emphasizes dialogue over
action and often shows how people speak past each other.  In his prose, he
experiments with subjective modes of narration that give readers access to
the thoughts and feelings of the characters.

In 1895, Schnitzler achieved a breakthrough with Liebelei (The Reckoning),
a play about love, betrayal, social class, and gender roles.  Liebelei
features a prototypical sweet girl, a young woman from the lower middle
classes involved in a relationship with an aristocratic man.  The 1896/97
Reigen (Hands Around) was to become Schnitzlers most controversial work.
The play consists of ten dialogues between lovers, one of whom will find a
new sexual partner in the next scene in each case.  Linking members from
different social classes into a sexual chain, the play exposes the power
asymmetries between them.  While Schnitzler was primarily a chronicler of
his time and society, he also wrote several historical plays, including the
1899 Der grne Kakadu (The Green Cockatoo), which is set at the beginning
of the French Revolution.

Later in his life, Schnitzler focused more on prose rather than drama.  His
1900 Leutnant Gustl (None But the Brave) introduced the interior
monologue into German literature.  The novellas stream of consciousness
shows how the protagonists mind is conditioned by clichs and conventions,
especially a vacuous military code of honor.  In the 1926 Traumnovelle
(Rhapsody), a married couple realizes the many possibilities of erotic
adventure and betrayal that lurk beneath their stable family lifethe
husband at a secret costume party and the wife in a dream.  This and other
works are evidence of the affinities between Schnitzler and his Viennese
contemporary Sigmund Freud.  Both are concerned with the duality of life
and death, the hidden truth of dreams, and the psychological mechanisms of
denial and repression.  Yet Schnitzler explores the workings of the
unconscious (or, as he called it, the middle consciousness) for the sake
of social analysis and critique.  He was a keen observer of the spread of
antisemitism and the crisis of liberalism in fin-de-sicle Vienna.  In his
1908 novel Der Weg ins Freie (The Road to the Open), he depicts the many
ways in which Viennese Jews responded to this crisis.
