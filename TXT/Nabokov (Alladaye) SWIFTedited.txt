Nabokov, Vladimir (, ) (1899-1977)


  Vladimir Nabokov was one of the leading novelists of the 20th century. He
was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899,  but  spent  most  of  his  life
abroad after his family was forced to emigrate in the wake of the  Bolshevik
revolution of 1917. He first composed novels  in  Russian  while  living  in
Berlin and Paris, but switched to  English  when  he  moved  to  the  United
States in 1940. His novel entitled Lolita (1955) was  immensely  successful.
Although he had been an American citizen since 1945, he came back to  Europe
in 1961, and lived in Montreux, Switzerland, where he died in 1977.

  Vladimir Nabokov was born on 23 April 1899 (10 April 1899 Old-Style),  in
St. Petersburg, to a wealthy, aristocratic family. His childhood  and  youth
were idyllic. He received a trilingual education, and from a very early  age
he could read and speak English and French (which were to play  a  prominent
part in his artistic career) alongside his  native  Russian.  These  halcyon
pre-revolutionary years  saw  the  birth  of  his  passion  for  entomology,
reading, and writing.
  The Bolshevik revolution brought this golden era to  a  brutal  stop.  In
February 1917, the Nabokovs had to leave their  St.  Petersburg  house,  and
first sought refuge in Crimea, hoping that their  exile  would  be  a  short
one. But the evacuation of Crimea in 1919 led the family to move,  first  to
England, then to Berlin, where Vladimir joined his relatives in  1922  after
studying Slavic and Romance languages for three years  at  Trinity  College,
Cambridge. His first months in Berlin were marked by  two  major  events  in
his personal life.  In  March  1922  his  father  was  shot  dead  during  a
political rally, and in May 1923, he  met  Vera  Evseyevna  Slonim  whom  he
married in April 1925. It is against  this  background  that  he  began  his
literary career under the pseudonym  of  Sirin.  He  published  poems  and
articles written in his native Russian, as  well  as  literary  translations
from the French or the English in a number of migr journals in Berlin  and
Paris such as Sovremmenye Zapiski and Rul. But  success  really  came  with
the publication of  his  first  novels:  Mashenka  (Mary,  1926),  Zashchita
Luzhina (The Defense, 1930), Camera Obscura (Laughter in  the  Dark,  1932),
Otchayanie (Despair, 1934) and Dar (The Gift, 1937). The Gift  is  the  last
novel Nabokov ever composed in Russian and arguably his best effort  in  his
native  language.  In  this  knstlerroman  where  the  protagonist,  Fyodor
Godunov-Cherdyntsev, a young Russian migr, develops his gift as a  writer,
Nabokov brings together a colourful depiction of  the  Russian  diaspora  in
the 1920s, a  poignant  evocation  of  his  heros  Russian  youth  and  the
biography of Nikolai Chernyshevsky,  a  19th-century  Russian  revolutionary
democrat, materialist philosopher and critic.
  In 1937, the rise of Nazism prompted Nabokov to leave Germany for  France
where he published, in French, in La Nouvelle Revue Franaise, a long  study
of Pushkin entitled Pouchkine, ou le vrai  et  le  vraisemblable.  Yet  in
May, 1940, the Second World War and the looming German invasion  forced  the
Nabokovs, now a family of three after the  birth  of  their  son  Dmitri  in
1934, to seek refuge in America.  This  new  exile  led  to  Nabokovs  most
momentous literary move: he decided to relinquish  his  native  Russian  and
adopt the language of his new country. He did not arrive in  America  empty-
handed: he had spent his final years in France writing his  first  novel  in
English, The Real Life of Sebastian  Knight,  which  was  published  in  May
1941. In October 1940, he met Edmund Wilson,  who  was  to  become  a  close
friend (until their falling out, twenty years  later)  and  would  introduce
him to American publishers. During his  American  years,  Nabokov  supported
his family by working for  some  time  as  the  curator  of  lepidoptery  at
Harvard  Universitys  Museum  of  Comparative  Zoology  (his  career  as  a
entomologist was almost as  rich  and  distinguished  as  his  career  as  a
writer), and by  teaching  Russian  and  European  literature  at  Wellesley
College and Cornell University.
  This was the context in which Lolita came to  life  and  exploded.  The
novel, which  was  composed  largely  while  travelling  on  the  butterfly-
collection trips in the western United States that Nabokov  undertook  every
summer, was initially published in  France  (but  in  its  original  English
version) by Olympia Press in 1955, and only appeared in  the  United  States
three years later, after a protracted legal  battle.  The  book  topped  the
best-seller  lists  and  Nabokov  rose  to  worldwide  fame,  although  this
notoriety had to do, more often than not, with  the  huge  controversy  that
the novel generated. Its plot is admittedly risqu as the protagonist  tells
the story of his obsession and sexual relationship with a  12-year-old  girl
nicknamed Lolita, but reducing the novel to this simplistic line is  clearly
unfair, for Lolita is first and  foremost  a  stylistic  masterpiece,  which
completes Nabokovs literary  metamorphosis  into  an  American  writer.  In
1962, the novel was turned into a movie directed by  Stanley  Kubrick  whose
screenplay was written by Nabokov himself.
  Lolita, whose American dbut was preceded chronologically by the
publication of Pnin (1957), remains the turning point in Nabokovs literary
career. Its immense success, and the financial benefits that ensued, made
it possible for Nabokov to interrupt his academic career to concentrate
exclusively on his writing and ponder his move back to Europe. In 1961,
Nabokov and his wife settled in Montreux (Switzerland) where they occupied
a suite at the Palace Htel.
  The Montreux retreat was not synonymous with retirement. On the contrary,
the 1960s were a  particularly  active  period  for  Nabokov.  In  1962,  he
published Pale Fire, one of the  most  brilliant  novels  ever  written.  It
consists of a 999-line poem by John Shade and its commentary by an  academic
named Charles Kinbote, followed by an Index. Its narrative structure  is  so
complex that to this day, despite the critics in-depth  investigations,  it
is still impossible to establish clearly the identity of the narrator(s).
  While composing Pale Fire Nabokov was also pursuing another major  quest:
always a great admirer  of  Pushkin,  he  wanted  to  produce  an  annotated
translation of his novel in verse, Eugene Onegin. The four-volume work  (one
volume for the translation itself and three volumes of  notes)  appeared  in
1964.  In  1966,  Nabokov  published  Speak,  Memory,  whose  subtitle,  an
autobiography revisited, indicates that it was the  revised  version  of  a
text originally composed in English  under  the  title  Conclusive  Evidence
(1951), then rewritten in Russian as Drugie Berega (1954).
  The autobiography preceded, Ada or Ardor  (1969),  yet  another  stunning
masterpiece. Ada is a family chronicle recounting the  lifelong  love  story
between Van and his sister, Ada. The story covers a whole century and  takes
place  in  a  fictional  world,   Antiterra,   whose   geography,   although
reminiscent of our earth, creates a subtle feeling of  estrangement  in  the
reader. This novel unites Nabokovs artistic worlds in a perfect  synthesis:
while it frequently refers to the classics  of  Russian  (and  more  largely
European) literature, it is also a striking demonstration of his ability  to
fashion his own artistic idiom and map out his America.
  After Ada, Nabokov transitions into the final phase of  his  career.  The
last novel published in his lifetime was Look At the Harlequins!  (1974),  a
fictional autobiography narrated by Vadim Vadimovich N., a  Russian-American
writer with remarkable biographical likenesses to Nabokov himself.
  Nabokov died in 1977 while composing The Original of Laura. He  expressed
the wish that the manuscript be destroyed if he could not complete  it.  Yet
in 2009, after years of hesitation, Dmitri  Nabokov,  his  son,  decided  to
publish the unfinished novel  a manuscript consisting of 138 index cards.
