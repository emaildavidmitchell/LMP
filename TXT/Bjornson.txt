Bjrnstjerne Bjrnson is one of the most important Scandinavian  writers  of
the second half of the 19th  century,  as  well  as  a  journalist,  theatre
director, and political activist. In the  Scandinavian  context,  he  was  a
pioneer of a variety of  literary  forms,  including  late  Romantic  prose,
historical and  bourgeois  drama,  and  the  modern  novel.  He  was  deeply
involved in the literary and political debates of his age,  both  in  Norway
and elsewhere in Europe, where he enjoyed,  at  least  until  his  death,  a
certain public recognition. He received the Nobel Prize  for  literature  in
1903.

Bjrnstjerne Bjrnson was born in 1832 in Kvikne, in the Norwegian  district
of sterdalen. He made his literary debut in 1857  with  Synnve  Solbakken,
the first of a series of prose works which combined a late Romanticism  with
an interest in the contemporary period and  problems.  The  main  characters
Synnve and Thorbjrn and the contrast between good and evil they  represent
are still dependent on the stylization of Romanticism, but  the  environment
in which they grow up is a problematic social space in which alcoholism  and
bigotism plague the population. Such  a  duality  is  also  evident  in  his
historical plays published between  1857  and  1862.  Bjrnsons  production
took a turn towards the Modern Breakthrough  with  the  play  En  Fallit  (A
Bankruptcy, 1875), which introduced theatrical realism  in  Scandinavia  and
paved the way  for  Henrik  Ibsen.  From  this  point  on,  Bjrnson  almost
exclusively wrote literature  centred  on  contemporary  topics.  Two  years
before Ibsens A Dolls House,  he  published  the  novel  Magnhild  (1877),
focused on a woman that flees from marriage. In  the  same  year,  his  play
Kongen (The King) directly addressed the question of Republicanism and  made
Bjrnson an extremely  controversial  political  figure.  In  En  Hanske  (A
Gauntlet, 1883) he gave his answer to the issue of parity of  the  sexes  by
insisting on premarital virginity for men, and in Over vne.  Frste  stykke
(Beyond Human Might. First Part, 1883) he investigated the struggle  between
science and religion by portraying the rise and fall  of  a  pastor  who  is
said to perform miracles, but fails to heal his own neurotic wife.  Having
abandoned Christianity,  Bjrnson  developed  a  secular  faith  in  human
progress, which is evident in several  works  of  the  1890s,  alongside  an
interest in politics and in the cause of the working  classes.  He  died  in
Paris in 1910.
