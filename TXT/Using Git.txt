STEPS FOR WORKING WITH GIT



1. Go to the working directory for the repo

Type ‘cd’ then drag the REM folder into Terminal, so it reads: CD Users/…



2. type “git status” to check the status of the repo



3. type “git pull” to pull changes made by others to the repo



4. type “git add” then drag the file you’ve change into Terminal, so it reads: git add Users/…



5. Do this for each file you’ve changed



6. type git commit –m “[name of commit]” to create the commit for these edited files. For example: git commit –m “today’s changes”



7. type “git push origin master” to push this commit to the repository.



8. Enter your login credentials



9. All done!
