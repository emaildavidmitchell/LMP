MAX WEBER							Word Count: 223

Max Weber (1881-1961) was one of the most important early proponents of Cubism and Futurism in the United States and a major example of the impact of theories of the fourth dimension on modern art. He was born in 1881 in Russia to a Russian-Polish-Jewish family who emigrated to Brooklyn, New York when he was ten. Weber studied modernist painting in Paris in 1905 to 1908, at which time his style was influenced by Paul Cézanne and Fauvism. Around 1910, soon after returning to New York City, his style became very Cubist. It was also around this time that he became interested in the theories of the fourth dimension. He was fascinated with the speed, lights and motion of the modern American city, which clearly suggests he was also influenced by Futurism. These combined influences led to such Cubist-Futurist paintings about the modern American urban experience as Chinese Restaurant, and New York at Night (both done in 1915). After World War I, Weber often explored more spiritual and religious themes and traditional subjects such as landscapes, still lifes and portraits. In the 1930s and later, his subjects were often everyday people and places, which was typical of Social Realism.
