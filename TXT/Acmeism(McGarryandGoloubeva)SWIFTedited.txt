ACMEISM (АКМЕИЗМ) was a major literary movement of the Russian SILVER AGE.  Although difficult to date precisely, scholars generally agree that Acmeism unofficially began with the closing of the major SYMBOLIST publication VESY (THE SCALES) that coincided with the appearance of the journal APOLLON in 1909 and ended with the execution of its nominal founder, the poet, NIKOLAY GUMILYEV (1886-1921) shortly after the Russian Civil War. Conceptualized as a new school of poetry by two disaffected poets from the Guild of Poets (Tsekh Poetov), Gumilyev and Sergey Gorodetsky, Acmeism became one of the major currents in the post-Symbolist Russian literary avant-garde, competing with the more vociferous Futurism for advancing contemporary Russian poetry into the future. Despite the movement’s brief history and its seemingly conformist alignment with Symbolism, major Acmeist poets such as ANNA AKHMATOVA (1889-1938) and OSIP MANDELSTAM (1891-1938) placed Acmeism firmly on the map of both Russian and European modernism, on a par with Alexander Blok’s Symbolism and Vladimir Mayakovsky’s Futurism.

In contrast with Symbolism’s valorization of fluidity and Futurism’s experiments with linguistic destruction, Acmeism advocated figural precision and clarity, aiming at compressed and discrete poetic forms.  While drawing on multiple elements of classical and cultural mythology, Acmeist verse, nevertheless, is immersed in the world of social and physical realities, plucking its themes from everyday life.  Acmeism thus eschews the other-worldly mysticism of Symbolism and the ad hoc destructivism of Futurism by harnessing a constructive energy of being-in-the-world.

How can we remember our previous existences, the time we were in the abyss, with myriads of other possibilities of being, of which we know nothing except that they exist.



Gumilyev, “Acmeism and the Legacy of Symbolism”

How can we remember our previous existences, the time we were in the abyss, with myriads of other possibilities of being, of which we know nothing except that they exist.



Gumilyev, “Acmeism and the Legacy of Symbolism”The Acmeists rejected Symbolism and Futurism because they viewed their poetic projects as unrealizable.  Specifically, what the Acmeists found most problematic about both movements were their founding paradoxes: to know the unknowable and creation via destruction.  Was it possible, for example, Gumilyev asked, to remember, let alone know, a place where one has never been, and by extension, to create a new literary tradition from nothing?  Mandelstam reinforces this concern in his essay “Francois Villon” where he notes that what distinguished the French poet from his contemporaries of the late Middle Ages was his interest in the “timeless” things of everyday life, not the “moon,” the stars, and other things of the cosmos that he could only imagine but never know. Theoretically and practically, the shortcoming of Symbolism and Futurism, for the Acmeists, was that as movements they were held captive by pictures of idealistic goals that, for all intents and purposes, in either the Symbolist a priori or Futurist a posteriori senses, never did, nor could possibly exist. 







To replace Symbolism there is a new movement, which, whatever it is called – Acmeism (from the work ακμή – the highest degree of something, the flower, the time of flowering), or Adamism (a manfully firm, clear view of life).

Gumilyev, “Acmeism and the Legacy of Symbolism”Acmeists sought to correct this problem by setting the poet a different task.  Instead of envisioning the poet as a trailblazer, seer, discoverer, oracle, or destroyer as the Symbolists and Futurists did, the Acmeists viewed him as a craftsman, builder, laborer, and creator.  With this in mind, Acmeists believed that the poet’s task was to strive for the “highest degree” of clarity and precision in his verse as possible.  Acmeists thus eschewed manifestos of the type the Symbolists and Futurists authored that elucidated in a 

The Symbolists were poor stay-at-homes; they loved to travel, yet they felt unwell, uncomfortable in the cage of their own organisms or in that universal case which Kant constructed with the aid of his categories.

For the Acmeists, such a platform was nothing but a repetition of Kantian hierarchy of formal categories that served only to widen the chasm between subject and object.   The Acmeist poet’s theory was his practice as evidenced in the creative result derived from the force generated by the momentary contact between the craftsman and his material. 



A=A: what a magnificent theme for poetry!  Symbolism languished and yearned for the law of identity.  Acmeism made it its slogan and proposed its adoption instead of the ambiguous a realibus ad realiora.

Mandelstam, “Morning of Acmeism”

What madman would agree to build if he did not believe in the reality of his material, the resistance of which he knew he must overcome?

Mandelstam, “Morning of Acmeism”The radical extent to which Acmeist poets broke from the theoretical and practical precedents of their Symbolist contemporaries is apparent in both their nuanced notion of gravity and their peculiar definition of Logos.   For all the Acmeists, gravity is the fount of the poet-builder’s creativity, the natural force of resistance that holds the keystones of Gothic cathedrals together, making it possible not only for the mason to overcome with his chisel the resistance of every stone, but also the generation of more text via the addition of new pieces.  This is evident in the way Mandelstam celebrates the generative dynamism of the Middle Ages in the final poem of Stone, “Notre Dame” (1912).  Unlike his rendering of the Byzantine Orthodox basilica Hagia Sophia in the collection’s penultimate piece, Mandelstam presents the Catholic cathedral Notre Dame as an open-ended, historical structure built by man in Time from the ground up, against gravity, rather than as a finished, a-historical entity suspended from the eternity of heaven by God.

	



Where the Roman justice judged a foreign people,
Stands the basilica: first and joyous,
Just like Adam, with nerves stretching,
The vault, a cross of air, flexes its muscles.



But outside a secret plan emerges:
Here labored the strength of arching stone
So the freighted mass won't crush the walls,
And the cocky vault's battering ram is still.  Stanzas I & II from “Notre Dame”

The Acmeists’ textualist sense of gravity motivated their understanding of Logos.  The Acmeists did not define the Logos as the definitive center that functioned as the source of everything, be it life, meaning, or non-life.  As Mandelstam notes, there is no latent content to the Logos because it describes the “conscious sense” with which the poet approaches and handles the material of his craft, the word.  The Logos as such is, as Gumilev suggests in the concluding stanzas of “The Word,” what prevents creation from atrophying into archaic 

We have forgotten that the word alone

Shone radiant over the troubled earth,

And that in the Gospel of St. John

It is written that the word is God.

But we have limited its range

To paltry boundaries of this world,

And like the dead bees in an empty hive

Dead words emit a foul odor.

I have no use for elegiac legions,

Or for the charm of elegiac play

For me, all verse should be off kilter,

Not the usual way.



If only you knew what trash gives rise

To verse, without a tinge of shame,

Like bright dandelions by a fence,

Like burdock and like cocklebur.

Stanzas I & II from Akhmatova’s “I have no use for odic regiments”

I have no use for elegiac legions,

Stanzas I & II from Akhmatova’s “I have no use for odic regiments”just poetry, as Akhmatova indicates in her biting lyric, “I have no use for odic regiments,” thus comes not from lofty sources eternalized by tradition and convention, but rather from the unexpected, such as the trash heap one inadvertently passes every day on the street.

The current of time’s river

Will carry off all human deeds

And sink into oblivion

All peoples, kingdoms and their kings.



And if something still remains

Through sounds of horn and lyre,

It too will disappear into the maw of time

And not avoid the common fate.



Gavril Derzhavin, “The River of Time”

Steep goatish towns,

A mighty layering of flint,

Yet, there’s another ridge on height – 

Sheepish villages and churches!

There a plumb-line preaches,

Time gnaws, water teaches,

And a transparent forest of air

Has had a surfeit of them all.



Like a dead hornet from a hive,

A pied day is swept off with disgrace.

A hawkish night carries a burning chalk

And feeds the slate to erase

A day’s impressions away

From the iconoclastic board,

And shake off transparent visions

Like nestlings from the hand!



Stanzas III & IV from Mandelstam’s “The Slate Ode”

Acmeism’s contribution to European Modernism as an aesthetic / critical movement is profound and extends beyond the singular reputations of its leading poets, Mandelstam, Akhmatova, and Gumilyev.  Acmeist reconsiderations of the relationship between art and life and, by extension, time and history are decidedly contemporary and germane to recent conceptions of aesthetic production, historiography, and rhetoric.  To modern and post-modern critics of the so-called linguistic-turn, Mandelstam’s reading in “The Slate Ode” of the eighteenth-century Russian poet Gavril Derzhavin’s last poem, “The River of Time,” would most certainly resonate loudly: the “here and now” of the present drowns all peoples (poets and kings alike) and all realms (movements, conventions, and empires) in the perpetual flux of the present’s creative abyss.
