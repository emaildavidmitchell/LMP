Lucas, Colin Anderson (1906-1984)

Colin Lucas was one of the few first generation of MODERN MOVEMENT
architects in Britain who was English. His interest in a modern scientific
approach to design is evident from the earliest reinforced concrete
bungalow he designed for his parents in 1929 to his 1950s designs for the
Roehampton Alton West Estate, as is his career-long passion for concrete.
From 1934-39 he was a partner in Connell, Ward and Lucas, a firm that
played a major part in the evolution of modern architecture in England.
According to Arthur Korn they introduced a new language into British
architecture at a time when there were hardly any British architects
thinking in an uncompromisingly contemporary vernacular.[1] Lucas
compositions were distinct. He used planes of four-inch thick concrete to
explore the relationship of volume and skin with compositions underpinned
by the regulating lines of the Golden Section. An advocate of LE CORBUSIER,
Lucas very clearly strove for a functional solution. Form was something of
beauty only if it was fit for its purpose. Of aesthetics he said, I find
arguments on aesthetics as meaningless as they are endless.

Lucas was born on 29 December 1906 in Greenwich, London. He was the second
son of the three children of Ralph Lucas (b.1876), a mechanical engineer
and inventor, and his wife Mary, ne Juler (1882-1952), a composer. He was
educated at Cheltenham College from 1919 and at Trinity College, Cambridge
where he studied at the School of Architecture (1925-28). Lucas had little
exposure to modern architecture through a traditional education. His major
early inspiration came from a creative home life and on leaving college he
became manager of his fathers building firm Lucas, Lloyd & Co. In 1929
they constructed a family weekend house on the Thames at Bourne End. Known
as Noahs House, this was heralded as the first monolithic concrete house
to be built in England.

In 1930 Lucas married Dione Wilson and his career progressed slowly in a
tough economic climate with family commissions such as a weekend house for
his grandfather and the fit-out of his wifes cookery school, Le Petit
Cordon Bleu, London. His own weekend house, The Hopfield was completed in
1933 in Kent and attracted more publicity. Seen as a modern architect, he
was invited by WELLS COATES to join the avant-garde artist group Unit One,
who sought to familiarise the British public with modern art. Lucas also
became one of the first members of Coates MODERN ARCHITECTURE RESEARCH
GROUP (MARS), an English branch of the CONGRS INTERNATIONAUX
DARCHITECTURE MODERNE (CIAM).

In May 1934 Lucas joined two New Zealanders AMYAS CONNELL (1901-1980) and
Basil Ward (1902-76) in practice. Together they experimented with
techniques of monolithic reinforced concrete building. Lucas led a number
of private house projects - Dragons in Sussex (1936), Greenside at
Wentworth (1937, now demolished), Potcroft in Sutton (1937), 66 Frognal in
Hampstead (1938) and 26 Bessborough Road in Roehampton (1939). In NIKOLAUS
PEVSNERs view Lucas houses were often minor masterpieces.[2]

After the practice disbanded in 1939 Lucas spent the war years assisting
the British Research Station in the construction of defensive concrete
structures. He rejoined his family on the other side of the Atlantic, where
they had spent the war. When the couple decided to separate at the end of
the 1940s, Lucas moved back to England and with the help of Leslie Martin
(1909-2000), he joined the development section of the London County Council
in the late 1940s, becoming one of the first members of the housing
division in the architects department.

Lucas worked on the Ackroydon Estate in Wimbledon and later headed up the
Alton West team on the Roehampton Estate, which won an RIBA bronze medal in
1959. Of Roehampton he said, I think I learnt more about architecture and
how to run jobs with that than in the rest of my career.[3] Staying with
the LCC (latterly Greater London Council) until his retirement in 1978, he
preferred to stay closely involved in the projects and mainly kept out of
the public debate that followed his strong modern architectural output.
Lucas was awarded an OBE in 1972. He had remarried in 1952 to Pamela
Campbell.
