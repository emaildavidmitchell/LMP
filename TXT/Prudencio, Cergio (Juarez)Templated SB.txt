Prudencio’s musical work sets a dialogue between Andean and European avant-garde traditions; in this sense, he co-founded in 1980, and has since been director of the Orquesta Experimental de Instrumentos Nativos (OEIN, Experimental Orchestra of Indigenous Instruments), an ideological, musical and pedagogical project that asserts the Aimara music tradition from the Bolivian Altiplano by means of a contemporary expression. OEIN’s programme links local materials and forms to procedural techniques from avant-garde contemporary music. In this respect, Prudencio says in his book Hay que caminar sonando (2010): ‘the freedom of sound, the structural sense of the timbre, and time as a space are, among others, concepts I learned in the context of 20th century avant-garde music, but symptomatically I also discovered those categories in other way also within pre-Hispanic music of the Americas, where they had been already existing probably for millenniums’ (2010: 95). Prudencio’s reflections on Latin American musical identity undertakes a strong social commitment through projects like the OEIN and its Programa de Iniciación a la Música (PIM, Initiation to Music Programme). He stated that ‘we are not Latin Americans just because we were born or live in Latin America. Our identity implies a state of consciousness and an active position, or at least a survival instinct’ (2010: 58). The OEIN has achieved a wide international renown, performing in Latin American countries (Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia). and European and Asian nations as well (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Australia, Italy, and Korea).

The cataloguing of Prudencio’s repertoire and its stylistic characterization made here were taken from several Graciela Paraskevaídis’ texts —the inner notes from various cds and her article Imaginemos músicos: Cergio Prudencio, caminante altiplánico (2011).



Cergio Prudencio composed ten works for the OEIN, being the first the forerunner La ciudad (1980), followed by Tríptica (1986), Cantos de piedra (1989), Cantos de tierra (1990), Los peregrinos (1995), Cantos meridianos (1996), Uyariwaycheq (1998), Cantos crepusculares (1999), Otra ciudad (2005), and Cantos ofertorios (2007-2009). The orchestra is basically composed by wind instruments from the Bolivian Altiplano (a variety of tarkas, reed flutes, sikus, fifes, mohoceños and pinquillos) and percussion (Italaque bass drums, wankaras, chapacas, and ch’ajchas, among others). Every Prudencio’s piece for the OEIN shares the interest on the sonorous dimension (timbre, attacks, registers, textures, types of emission, dynamics, and articulation) and the articulation in a circular time. La ciudad, based on a poem by Blanca Wiethüchter, and dedicated to the city of La Paz, Bolivia, was the cornerstone in OEIN’s career, which started in 1980. It was composed for four groups of wind instruments of the Aimara musical tradition (quenas, pinquillos and fifes; tarkas, mohoceños and sikus) and percussion (bass drum and wankara), with a structure of twelve sonorous units of different length, which become anti-teleological by means of a continuity and break logic. The idea is to generate structures that are installed in a static time, which are modulated by a repetition procedure —in connection with the Altilplano’s dual principle of the arca-ira, that is ‘the alternation of sounds between two musicians regarding the configuration of music’ (Prudencio 2010: 118). On this subject, within his series of five Cantos (‘Chants’), his piece Cantos de tierra (‘Earth Chants’, 1990) clearly deals with the temporal conception from the Bolivian Altiplano cultures; Cantos crepusculares (‘Twilight Chants’, 1999) deals with the texture of the materials by means of reiterative cyclical procedures, and the structure in Cantos ofertorios (‘Offertory Chants’, 2007-09) is based on the offers made by the Aimara priests. This religious thinking is also present in Uyariwaycheq (1998), through two texts, an Andean and a Christian one. Through this dialectic between opposites and complementaries, Prudencio sets the specificity of Latin American History of the last five centuries.

His catalogue also includes pieces for traditional instruments, electroacoustic and mixed ones, as well as music for audiovisual and radio displays. He wrote fourteen soloist works, with Ámbitos (1998, for piano) as a highlight: it is articulated on different segments with tempi that either expand or contract, to which descriptive indications such as ‘calming down’, ‘like a heart beat’, ‘with emotion’, ‘like singing with sighs’, and ‘like waves’ are added. According to the author, Horizontes (2001), for piano, is structured in contrasting, non continuous units, through which the intention is to create atmospheres avoiding the conventional expressiveness of the piano. In both pieces the arca-ira principle is used, together with silences, ostinatos, and a structure built upon expressive sections. Umbrales (1994, for piano) and Solo (1994, for violin), together with Paisaje con habitantes (1994, for violin, cello and double bass), belong to a trilogy composed for the film Sayariy (1994), and the three pieces for piano of Figuraciones (2006), Esta distancia (2006, for cello), and Transfiguraciones (2006, for string quartet) were composed for the film Saber que te he buscado (2006), both directed by Mela Márquez.



He also composed chamber works for traditional formations like string quartets –for which his first production, Gestación (1976), was meant, and later on Transfiguraciones (2006)–, several instrumental ensembles, a trio and many duets —one of them, No te duermas, niño (for voice and piano) was registered in 2007. He wrote four pieces for percussion alone –Perpetuidad (1978); Juegos imaginados (1985-1987), A la sombra de una higuera (1996-1997), and Rastros/ Vestigios/ Sombras (2010), for prepared marimba–, and his electroacoustic production starts with Awasqa (1986), characterized by the austerity of the sound of the tube of a sikus and the play between sound and silence. However, most of his work in this area starts in 2005, with Titanias y Gestuales (2005), where each part stands out with a particular timbre, generally artificially manipulated. Eriales (2006) also explores the timbral dimension of sound, and is articulated through three sections: the first and the third ones with a linear time, the second one with a static and spatial time.
