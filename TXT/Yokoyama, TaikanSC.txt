Yokoyama, Taikan ( 横山大観) (1868- 1958) 

The name, Yokoyama Taikan, is synonymous with Nihonga (Japanese-style painting) and the Japan Art Institute (日本美術院 Nihon Bijutsuin).  Taikan was among the first batch of students enrolled at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in 1887 and was closely mentored by the school’s founder, Okakura Tenshin. When Tenshin left to establish the Japan Art Institute in 1898, Taikan followed along with an exodus of students from the school. His career became closely associated with the Institute and in 1914, Taikan revitalised and re-organised the Institute which had become inactive upon Tenshin’s passing. Taikan is well-known for his repertoire of works which include paintings of customs and manners (fûzoku-ga, 風俗画), historical figures and landscapes. He is most well-known for his paintings of Mount Fuji along with the works, Eight views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers (1912) and The Wheel of Life (1923) which are Important Cultural Properties. Throughout his life, Taikan continued to exhibit at almost every government-sponsored exhibition held, in addition to the exhibitions held by the Japan Art Institute. In 1937, Taikan was awarded the Order of Culture, a testament to the recognition of his achievement as a Nihonga artist.
