luard, Paul (1895-1952)

One of the founders of the surrealist  movement,  Paul  luards  poetry  is
often mistakenly classified as solely belonging to this style.  It  is  only
the first period of luards work, however, that can be  thus  defined.  The
second period is characterized by a more formally  restrained  poetic  style
and is expressive of a renewed interest  in  accessibility  to  the  reader.
This period was one of political activism, in which  luard,  breaking  with
the surrealists, was a central figure in the French  Resistance  and  active
member of the communist party.

Born Eugne Grindel to Bourgeois parents, luard  would  go  on  to  lead  a
tumultuous emotional and political life.    Married  three  times,  luards
poems are interlaced by themes of love, loss and renewal.  While  his  first
important book Le devoir et linquitude is published in  1917,  it  is  the
1926, Capitale de la douleur (Capital of Pain), inspired by his wife  Galas
desertion of him, that establishes his reputation. Much of his work  between
the years of 1926 until her sudden  death  in  1946,  is  dedicated  to  his
second wife  Nusch.  luard  would  himself  die  shortly  after  his  third
marriage to Dominique Laure.
