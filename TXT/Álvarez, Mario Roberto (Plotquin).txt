Mario Roberto lvarez, (University of Buenos Aires, 1937), has  founded  one
of the most prolific partnerships in  Argentina,  widely  strong  market  in
since 1962 when associated  to  architects  Leonardo  Kopiloff  and  Eduardo
Santoro. Concerning scale and  level  of  achievement,  most  of  the  works
constitute landmarks of the metropolitan skyline. The work  of  lvarez  has
managed to represent the serene and  elegant  taste  of  Argentinean  middle
upper class, which supported the developmentalist policies of  industry  and
international capital promotion. Although lvarez has been linked  to  state
offices, he has kept himself away from the  college  teaching.  However  his
work has kept influential and appealing both  to  institutional  demand  and
the real estate  market.  The  employ  of  the  curtain-wall  with  graceful
refined modulations and cadence, the colorful natural  stone  coverings  and
technical   implementation   of   metal   panelling   are    the    hallmark
characteristics of the work of lvarez, even in the most  complex  and  less
conventional engagements.

Among the first works, the San Martin Medical Corporation Sanitorium  (1936-
7) and the appartments on street Humberto I. in  Buenos  Aires  (1948-1950),
represent the modernist interest that lvarez showed already  as  a  student
and along a 1937-38 european tour as an Ader grantee. Apropriated  sunlight,
efficient distribution of surfaces and optimization  of  material  resources
were inspired by the interwar Italian Rationalism, biased by the  debate  on
regionalism and monumentality held  contemporarily.  The  health  facilities
built during the government of Juan Peron  in  the  provincial  capitals  of
Tucumn, Salta, Jujuy Catamarca and Corrientes embodied  such  material  and
regionalistic imprint.

lvarez focused on the development  of  rise  buildings  typologies  without
rejecting the own architectonical leading principles, applied  not  only  to
the resolution of multi-family  housing  as  Posadas  Street  (1957-59)  and
Panedile  (1963-69),  but  to  actually  complex  commisions  as  well.  The
Municipal  General  San  Martn  Theatre  (1952-60),  in  association   with
Macedonio Oscar Ruiz, the headquarters of Bank of America (1963-65) and  the
Banco Popular Argentino head offices (1964-68), in Buenos Aires,  are  early
masterpieces,  that  demonstrate  lvarez   full   expertise   in   advanced
architectural proposals and modern materials which resulted in  accomplished
technical solutions. These works are proof of the profound awareness of  the
succesfull work of Pietro  Bellusci,  Oscar  Niemeyer,  S.O.M.  among  other
references.

The headquarters building of Deutsche Klub - Goethe Institut  (1970-72)  and
the shop
and business facilities Galeras Jardn (1974-1977)  provided  Buenos  Aires
with examples of the sophisticated metropolitan avant-garde proposals  after
CIAM. Though lvarez adopted mostly the reinforced concrete structures,  the
Ken Brown manufacturing facilities (1966-68) and  the  SOMISA  head  offices
(1966-1977) are unprecedented metal frame buildings.

Engineering commitments  like  the  "Ral  Uranga-Carlos  Sylvestre  Begnis"
underwater tunnel below the Paran river  between  the  provinces  of  Entre
Rios and Santa Fe (1963- 65) and the bridge over  the  San  Martn  railroad
tracks  (1966-1967);  interventions  in  existing  buildings  such  as   the
extensions of Teatro  Nacional  Cervantes(1961-1969),  Teatro  Coln  (1969-
1972), the Guemes Sanitorium (1970)  and  the  Stock  Exchange  headquarters
(1972-1977) testify to  the  technical  expertise  of  the  Office  and  the
ability to respond to such serious commitments.
