Parole in libert
[pic]

Translatable as words in freedom or liberated words, the phrase is an
essential slogan of the Italian Futurist movement, and refers to a radical
new way of using literary language and liberating it from the bounds of
tradition. First coined by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in the Technical
Manifesto of Futurist Literature (1912) and further defined in texts such
as Destruction of Syntax/Imagination without Strings/ Words-in-Freedom
(1913) and Geometric and Mechanical Splendor and the Numerical
Sensibility (1914), the phrase has come to define the entire futurist
aesthetic of visual language. The technique primarily applies to the
invention of specific tables of words (tavole parolibere) artfully arranged
in typographical innovative patterns (e.g. through the procedure of
typographic analogy, where, the verb to go down has to graphically
mimic the action of descending).
Among the techniques involved by the method prescribed by the manifestos
are the exclusive use of verbal infinitive, the abolition of adjectives,
adverbs and punctuation, and the intense use of onomatopoeic words. The
noun gains absolute primacy, putting reality starkly on the page. Words are
mainly connected through analogy, juxtaposed without conjunctions or
logical connectors (e.g. uomo-torpediniera, man-torpedo boat). Together
with the destruction of syntax, the destruction of traditional subjectivity
is pursued, by replacing logical patterns of thought with intuition and a
wireless imagination.
