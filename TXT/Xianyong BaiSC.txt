Bais debut work The Last Night of Jin Daban (Jin daban de zuihou yiye)
appeared in 1958 in Literary Magazine, founded by his teachers Xia Jian
(1916-1965) and Wu Luqin (1918-1983). In 1960, following the suspension of
Literary Magazine, Bai together with his classmates founded Modern
Literature to continue the ideals set out by his teachers: to promote the
integration of both old and new, Chinese and foreign literature and arts.

Bai left Taiwan in 1963 to study literary theory and creative writing at
the University of Iowa, and published Death in Chicago (Zhijiage zhi si)
in 1964. The short story conveys the estrangement of the protagonist Wu
Hanhun (a pun of without a Chinese soul  or I am a Chinese soul))
as he sojourns in America. While at Iowa, Bai finished Fallen Immortal
(Zhexian ji, 1965), another story that depicts the loneliness and
disillusionment of the overseas Chinese students. Both works end with the
protagonists suicide in a foreign land, highlighting the double alienation
(from the mainstream American culture and from the protagonists own
homeland, China or Taiwan) of the rootless generation.

Upon graduating with a MA degree in 1965, Bai began to teach Chinese
literature at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In parallel with
his long teaching career, Bai continued to publish creative works.
Important works from this period include Taipei People and Chrystal Boys.
After retirement in 1994, he devoted himself to promoting kunqu[1] art and
collecting material for writing a biography for his father. His adaptation
of the Ming Dynasty play The Peony Pavilion (Mudan ting) was well
acclaimed, and the two-volume My Father and the Republican China was
published in 2012.

Bais Taipei People is concerned with the individual lives against a
historical backdrop of social and cultural turbulence. Hailed as equivalent
to James Joyces Dubliners, it details the exilic mentality of people from
different social strata who came to Taiwan from Mainland China after 1949.
Stylistically, Taipei People is full of symbols, juxtapositions between the
past and the present, as well as parody of individual destiny and
historical changes. As a modernist text, it exemplifies Bais application
of Western literary techniques and his familiarity with classical Chinese
literature and art.

In 1976, Bai published Lonely Seventeen (Jimo de shiqisui). In an eponymous
story, Bai depicts a teenage protagonists distressed life under his
fathers authority, and his sense of unworthiness for being unable to meet
his fathers expectations. The protagonists burgeoning same-sex desire is
also featured in this story, paving the way for Bais Crystal Boys, which
is about the marginalized status of Taiwans gay community during the
1970s.

The main protagonist in Crystal Boys is shunned by his family due to his
homosexuality. He drifts into New Park, a haven for gay cruising in Taipei.
 With Chief Yang providing a surrogate love for younger gay males who
loitered in New Park, an alternative family model is established. In this
novel, Bai deconstructs various forms of patriarchy at work that jeopardize
individual freedom and ostracize people who are deemed unethical. They
include schools, bias toward homosexuals, and notions of loyalty and filial
piety. As many of the fathers of the gay young men in Chrystal Boys are
associated with the Nationalist government, Bais critique of these
authoritative structures implies a challenge to the Nationalist
governments rule at large.

In 2007, Bai published New Yorker (Niuyue ke), a short story collection
that offers a fair summary of Bais thematic preferences: the cultural
displacement of overseas Chinese, individual lives in light of historical
change, and the possibility of a gay narrative. They bespeak his interest
in speaking for the oppressed people and calling for humanity and
tolerance.
