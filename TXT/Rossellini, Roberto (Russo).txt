Roberto Rossellini (8 May 1906  3 June 1977)

Roberto Rossellini (Roberto Gastone Zeffiro Rossellini, Rome, 8 May  1906  
3 June 1977) was an Italian film director, screenwriter  and  producer.  His
early work appeared at the height of Fascismtwo shorts, now  lost,  on  the
subject of nature: Daphne (1936)  and  Prlude    l'aprs-midi  d'un  faune
(1938). At the beginning of the 1940s, he released his first  feature  films
exalting the virtues of World War II combatants: La nave bianca  (1941),  on
a group of Italian sailors on a hospital ship, Un pilota ritorna (1942),  on
the war between Italy and Greece,  and  Luomo  della  croce  (1943),  about
military chaplains on the Russian front. With these three films,  which  are
often referred to as the Fascist trilogy, Rossellinis work is  considered
to be highly controversial  for  his  use  of  certain  Fascist  ideological
themes that he would definitively  abandon  in  the  wars  aftermath.  This
trilogy  already  crosses  realism  and  documentary  filming  with   social
aesthetics, humanist concerns, and a sharp  observation  of  everyday  life.
These traits will characterize  Rossellinis  postwar  neorealism  and  will
never completely disappear from the different phases of his future work.

In fact, with the trilogy  Roma  citt  aperta  (1945),  Pais  (1946),  and
Germania anno zero  (1948),  Rossellini  is  acknowledged  as  the  founding
father of neorealism, understanding realism  as  nothing  but  the  artistic
form of truth, and cinema as a means to show, not to explain, and thus  to
conduct a social inquiry. The first two of these social films evoke the  war
of liberation from fascist and Nazi oppressors, while  Germania  deals  with
the traumatic aftermath to World War II and the fall  of  the  Third  Reich.
Towards the end of the decade, Rossellini turns away from the experience  of
war and works on two comedies: Lamore (1948), dedicated  to  Anna  Magnani,
who also acts in  the  movie,  and  La  macchina  ammazzacattivi  (1952),  a
Brechtian reflection on evil.

In 1948, the already famous Swedish actress  Ingrid  Bergman,  after  seeing
Roma citt aperta and Pais, writes to Rossellini proposing to  collaborate.
This  letter  signals  the  beginning  of  one  of  the  most  popular   and
controversial love stories in the history of cinema, and, at the same  time,
Rossellinis engagement with a cinema  of  intimacy  where  social  analysis
encounters spiritual exploration. Rossellinis new phase,  which  spans  the
first half of the 1950s, is concerned with the personal anxiety,  crisis  of
communication, and loss of traditional values produced by  Fascism  and  the
war. Stromboli, terra di Dio (1950), filmed on the  slopes  of  the  Italian
volcano that gives the movie its title, is  the  first  work  with  Bergman,
followed by Europa  '51  (1952),  Siamo  Donne  (1953),  Viaggio  in  Italia
(1953), La paura (1954), and Giovanna d'Arco al rogo (1954).  Stromboli  and
Viaggio  in  Italia  drew  the  attention  of  future  French   New   Waves
filmmakersthen  criticsFranois  Truffaut,  Jean-Luc  Godard,   and   ric
Rohmer, who considered Rossellini one of the  first  modern  auteurs.  As  a
result of  such  admiration,  Godard  invited  Rossellini  to  work  on  the
screenplay of Les Carabiniers (The carabineers, 1963).

In 1957 Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister, invited Rossellini to film  a
documentary in India. The journey triggers his  break-up  with  Bergman  and
his subsequent marriage with Sonali Das Gupta, a screenwriter for the  film.
It also gives rise to  an  exotic  detour  in  his  career,  represented  by
LIndia vista da Rossellini and India Matru Bhumi,  a  title  that  combines
fiction  and  documentary.  In  these  years  Rossellini   looks   for   new
perspectives and returns to the theme of the  war  with  Il  generale  della
Rovere (1959), winner of the Golden Lion at Venice, and  Era  notte  a  Roma
(1960). In the 60s, with Viva lItalia  (1960)  depicting  Garibaldis  epic
campaign in 19th century Sicily during the Risorgimento,  Rossellini  begins
what is considered to be his didactic and educational phase, concerned  with
the history of Western civilization. In 1961, he releases Vanina Vanini,  an
adaptation of the homonymous tale by Stendhal, and  in  1966  La  presa  del
potere da parte de Luigi XIV. At the beginning of the 70s, Rossellini  makes
a number of films for television,  which  he  praises  for  its  pedagogical
potentiality against pernicious mass society. These movies treat  the  lives
of historical figures such as  Socrate  (1971),  Agostino  dIppona  (1972),
Let di Cosimo dei Medici (1972), Cartesio (1973), and  Il  messia  (1975),
on the figure  of  Christ.  Rossellini  dies  of  a  heart  attack  in  1977
returning from the Cannes Film Festival.
