RESNAIS, Alain (3 June 1922- 1 March 2014)

Alain Resnais was a French film director, contemporaneous with the French
New Wave but drawing his inspiration for his own films play with narrative
and structure from writers and intellectuals.  He made a series of short
films in the late 1940s and early 1950s, many of them focusing on art and
artists.  His most celebrated short film, Night and Fog (1955), is a
meditation on Nazi concentration camps and war responsibility.  Resnais
found critical acclaim for a series of feature films exploring the
intersection of history and memory through nonlinear narrative: Hiroshima
Mon Amour (1959), LAnne dernire  Marienbad (Last Year at Marienbad,
1961), and Muriel, ou le Temps dun retour (Muriel, 1963).  Unlike
directors of the contemporaneous French New Wave, Resnais preferred to
shoot from scripts written in collaboration with others.  In his early
career he worked with novelists Marguerite Duras, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and
Jorge Semprn, among others.  After a series of abandoned projects, Resnais
was brought in to direct the commercial success Stavisky  (1974), starring
Jean-Paul Belmondo and with a score by Stephen Sondheim.  Despite his
reputation as a filmmaker for intellectuals, Resnais had a lifelong love
for popular culture, and directed films based on comic books and musicals.
He directed three films based on plays by the British comedic playwright
Alan Ayckbourn.
