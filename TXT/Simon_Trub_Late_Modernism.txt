|Late modernism is a critics term rather than one that artists used  |
|themselves. Like modernism, it can refer to a literary period, style,|
|or genre, and like modernism, it is exceedingly difficult to         |
|pinpoint. Accordingly, various critics use late modernism to refer |
|to different time periods or sets of writers from roughly the        |
|nineteen thirties up to the present. Invariably, however, late       |
|modernism describes literature that continues characteristics        |
|associated with modernism beyond the culmination of high modernism.  |
|Hence, late modernism exists at a distance to the modernisms of the  |
|1910s and 1920s. It marks a point at which modernist artists become  |
|self-consciously modernist, or at which modernist aesthetics become  |
|less effective or more difficult to continue. Thus, independently of |
|its precise use, late modernism signals a limit of modernism beyond|
|which it becomes something else.                                     |
|Emergence and Use                                                    |
|Michael Whitworth explains that late modernism belongs to the same |
|family of concepts as high modernism and postmodernism. Locating |
|its first use in 1975, he maintains that all three of these terms    |
|originated in the 1970s in the discourse about postmodernism (274-5).|
|In fact, Frank Kermode uses late modernism already in a 1965       |
|lecture to refer to contemporary literature, but Whitworths         |
|observations are highly instructive about the kind of concept late  |
|modernism is (The Sense of an Ending 103). Unlike high modernism  |
|and postmodernism, however, late modernism was not used widely in|
|literary criticism until the late twentieth century. From then       |
|onward, books, book chapters, and journal articles on late modernist |
|literature have proliferated. The increasing frequency with which    |
|late modernism is used in criticism from the turn of the millennium  |
|on can be associated with the beginnings and development of the new  |
|modernist studies, that is, with the aim of modernist studies from   |
|the late 1990s on to extend the canon of literary modernism. The     |
|concept of late modernism allows scholars to push further back the |
|temporary boundaries of modernism and thus to discover new artists   |
|that can be considered modernist or to resituate modernist classics  |
|in literary history.                                                 |
|                                                                     |
|When and What Was or Is Literary Late Modernism?                     |
|Generically or stylistically, late modernism denotes literature that |
|continues modernist aesthetics after high modernism, either while    |
|recognising their increasing inadequacies and anticipating           |
|postmodernism, or while affirming their relevance and efficiency in  |
|the face of literary and historical change. Periodically, late       |
|modernism refers to a transition between modernism and postmodernism |
|that can overlap to various degrees with either of these two periods.|
|Alan Wilde is widely recognised as the first literary critic to use  |
|the concept of late modernism systematically. In Horizons of Assent  |
|(1981), Wilde associates late modernism with literature of the 1930s,|
|that is, mainly but not exclusively with the Auden Group. Late     |
|modernist literature, according to Wilde, continues the modernist    |
|conception of art as representing an ideal, truth, or essence that is|
|capable of redeeming a culture or society fragmented by the processes|
|of modernisation. However, in contrast to high modernist literature, |
|late modernist texts locate this ideal, truth, or essence in surface |
|appearances rather than beyond them (Horizons 107-8). While they thus|
|represent a qualified or reluctant continuation of modernist         |
|aesthetic idealism, they anticipate the postmodernist privileging of |
|surface over depth. The late modernist engagement with appearances   |
|rather than hidden essences, Wilde suggests, is the result of a      |
|growing suspicion of or dissatisfaction with modernist aestheticism  |
|(43, 118-9).                                                         |
|                                                                     |

|W. H. Auden                                                          |
|                                                                     |
|Tyrus Millers Late Modernism (1999) signals the beginning of the    |
|growing interest in late modernism around the turn of the millennium.|
|Focusing on Wyndham Lewis, Djuna Barnes, Samuel Beckett, and Mina    |
|Loy, Miller dates the emergence of late modernism rather precisely to|
|1926, the year of the General Strike (10, 27). Like Wilde, Miller,   |
|thus, identifies late modernism with the latter half of the interwar |
|period, and like Wilde, he associates it with the decline of the     |
|modernist ideal of aesthetic autonomy. Miller maintains: Late       |
|modernist writing . . . coheres as a distinctive literary type     |
|within the historical development of modernist literature, serving as|
|an index of a new dispensation, a growing skepticism about modernist |
|sensibility and craft as means of managing the turbulent forces of   |
|the day (20). The high modernist conception of art as offering an   |
|autonomous order capable of mitigating the alienation and            |
|fragmentation of contemporary society, according to Miller, became   |
|increasingly untenable for artists in the late 1920s. Interestingly, |
|Miller presents late modernism both as a reaction against the        |
|formalism of earlier modernism and as failure to continue the project|
|of the modernist avant-garde (20). On the one hand, according to his |
|account, late modernist literature aims at unsettling the aesthetic  |
|unity and order championed by high modernism (18). On the other hand,|
|the political upheavals of the late 1920s and 1930s made it ever more|
|difficult to create politically uncommitted art, while the radical   |
|artistic experimentalism of earlier modernism was increasingly       |
|assimilated by society and the market (29-32).                       |
|                                                                     |

|Literary critic Fredric Jameson in Postmodernism (1991) briefly      |
|considers the usefulness of the category of late modernism to refer|
|to the last survivals of a properly modernist view of art and the   |
|world after the great political and economic break of the            |
|Depression, and he tentatively proposes as late modernist writers   |
|Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, Beckett, Charles Olson, and     |
|Louis Zukovsky (305). Jameson returns to the notion of late         |
|modernism and examines it in more detail in A Singular Modernity    |
|(2002). There, he boldly describes late modernism as an American    |
|invention and a product of the Cold War (165). According to       |
|Jameson, late modernism signals in the realm of art the completion of|
|the project of modernisation, which had been interrupted by the      |
|Second World War (165-8). It marks the moment or stage in the        |
|development of modernism at which artists become aware of modernism  |
|as movement, at which they self-consciously identify with it and     |
|reduce its radical experimentalism to a set of aesthetic conventions |
|(166-7, 197-200). Accordingly, late modernism can also be identified |
|with the establishment of a modernist canon, that is, with the       |
|formation of a discrete group of works or artists that modernists    |
|recognise as significant, but also with the emergence of a canon of  |
|modernist works and artists (197, 210). In Singular Modernity,       |
|Jameson associates late modernism with abstract expressionism, New   |
|Criticism, and more specifically with Wallace Stevenss writings,    |
|while he also at length discusses Maurice Blanchot, Karl-Heinz       |
|Bohrer, Nabokov, and Beckett as late modernists (168-9, 183-93,      |
|200-10).                                                             |

|Similarly to Jameson, and in contrast to Wilde and Miller, Anthony   |
|Mellors identifies late modernism with post-1945 literature in Late  |
|Modernist Poetics: From Pound to Prynne. Dating late modernism       |
|schematically to the period 1945-1975, Mellors focuses on poetry   |
|and chiefly discusses Charles Olson and J. H. Prynne (2). He         |
|maintains that late modernist poets politically distance themselves  |
|from their modernist predecessors, notably from Ezra Pound, T. S.    |
|Eliot, and W. B. Yeats, because the latter in different ways and to  |
|different degrees engaged with European fascism. Yet, Mellors shows  |
|that, just like Pound, Eliot, and Yeats, late modernists endow art or|
|culture with the power to restore corrupt society to an organic      |
|community, and they accordingly establish the artist in the position |
|of a social or cultural authority. Thus, according to Mellorss      |
|account, late modernists explicitly disagree with the totalitarian   |
|politics of major earlier modernists, while they continue the        |
|latters totalitarian aesthetics or poetics (42).                    |
|                                                                     |

|                                                                     |
|Other scholars and artists maintain that modernism continues beyond  |
|1975. In 21st-Century Modernism: The New Poetics (2002), for       |
|example, Marjorie Perloff does not use the term late modernism but   |
|she discusses as modernists late twentieth-century poets such as     |
|Susan Howe, Charles Bernstein, Lyn Hejinian, and Steve McCaffery. The|
|postulation of a poetic modernism around the turn of the millennium  |
|finds further support in the poetry anthology Vanishing Points: New  |
|Modernist Poems, which was published in 2004. Similarly, with respect|
|to fiction, David James examines the modernist aesthetics of novels  |
|by Milan Kundera, Philip Roth, Michael Ondaatje, J. M. Coetzee, Ian  |
|McEwan, and Toni Morrison in Modernist Futures (2012). James invokes |
|the notion of late modernism, particularly as conceptualised by      |
|Miller and Jameson, but he only reservedly endorses it (16, 20-1).   |
|                                                                     |
|Architecture                                                         |
|Literary scholars generally agree that late modernism had been used|
|in architectural criticism by Charles Jencks before it entered their |
|vocabulary. Jencks himself recollects that [t]he term               |
|Late-Modernism rose in 1977 as a convenient label to distinguish   |
|one group of creative artists from another, from the group with which|
|they were often confused, Post-Modernists (Late-Modern Architecture |
|6). According to Jencks, architectural late modernism is contemporary|
|with postmodernism. Both movements or styles emerged in the 1960s.   |
|They succeeded the Modern Movement or International Style of         |
|modernist architecture and consequently also represent different     |
|reactions to the latter. Jencks defines late modernist architecture  |
|as follows: basically, the approach is pragmatic rather than        |
|idealist, and ultra-modern in its exaggeration of several modern     |
|aspects  extreme logic, extreme circulatory and mechanical emphasis,|
|a mannered and decorative use of technology, a complication of the   |
|International Style . . . and an abstract rather than conventional   |
|language of form. To these essentially Mannerist qualities ought to  |
|be added the most ultra-modern and mannered one of all: the tendency |
|to shock by discontinuity, by newness, by being a self-sufficient,   |
|avant-garde statement cut off from traditional architecture         |
|(Late-Modern Architecture 13). According to Jencks, late modern      |
|architecture is ultra modern. It exaggerates the emphasis on         |
|rationality, technology, abstraction, and avant-gardism of modernist |
|architecture to such an extent that not even modernist architects    |
|would have approved (Late-Modern Architecture 6-7, Postmodern and   |
|Late Modern 48-9). Accordingly, it is also exceedingly elitist, like |
|or even more than modernist architecture. Postmodern architecture, by|
|contrast, Jencks maintains, communicates not only with the           |
|architectural elite but also with the public (Postmodern and Late   |
|Modern 33). Hence, postmodern architecture is defined by an        |
|interest in popular and local codes of communication . . . , in      |
|historical memory, urban context, ornament, representation, metaphor,|
|participation, the public realm, pluralism and ecclecticism         |
|(Late-Modern Architecture 13).                                       |

|Limit-Modernism                                                      |
|In Postmodernist Fiction (1987), Brian McHale briefly considers texts|
|that need to be located between modernism and postmodernism, and     |
|while he refers to Wildes conception of late modernism he proposes  |
|the term limit-modernism instead (10-3). The texts McHale discusses|
|as examples of limit-modernism were predominantly published in the   |
|1950s and 1960s (12-21).                                             |
|                                                                     |
|Neo-Modernism                                                        |
|Neo-Modernism is occasionally used synonymously with late modernism. |
|Jameson does so, for example, in Singular Modernity, where he also   |
|suggests that the term was probably invented by literary critic Frank|
|Kermode (197-8, 238n26). In an essay entitled The Modern, Kermode  |
|distinguishes between palaeo- and neo-modernism, which he later  |
|also calls traditionalist and schismatic modernism (8, 27). He   |
|makes the same distinction in The Sense of an Ending, where he refers|
|to different stages or phases of modernism, namely to an older or    |
|earlier and a new or later modernism (103-4, 114). In The Sense of an|
|Ending, Kermode identifies earlier modernism with the 1910s and      |
|1920s, and new modernism with the 1950s and 1960s (103, 114). The  |
|former kind of modernism is represented by Pound, Yeats, Wyndham     |
|Lewis, T. S. Eliot, and Joyce, while the latter is discussed with    |
|reference to the Beat Generation, William Burroughs, and Emmett      |
|Williams. Beckett is located in between. In The Modern, Kermode    |
|discusses as neo-modernist Marcel Duchamp, Robert Rauschenberg, John |
|Cage, and Jean Tinguely (14). Kermodes distinctions between         |
|palaeo- and neo-modernism, traditionalist and schismatic      |
|modernism, and early and new modernism account for different modes  |
|of modernism, that is, for different emphases of sensibilities or    |
|aesthetico-cultural positions that are associated with modernism     |
|overall. The kind of modernism described by the first terms of these |
|oppositions is chiefly informed by nostalgia for a lost cultural or  |
|social order and accordingly also by admiration for older artistic   |
|traditions. The modernism to which the second terms of the           |
|oppositions refer privileges the revolutionary call to make it new.|
|Kermode emphasises that these varieties of modernism are intricately |
|related to each other and that even though they have peaked in       |
|different decades, instances of them can be found throughout the     |
|entire period of modernism (103-4). Kermodes neo-modernism, in    |
|contrast to the term postmodernism, stresses the continuities      |
|between literature of the 1950s and 1960s and earlier modernism,     |
|while it also signifies a renewal of modernism, the existence of a   |
|new kind (23-4; see also Eysteinsson 106). The connotation of        |
|modernist renewal distinguishes the term neo-modernism from late  |
|modernism and informs other uses of neo-modernism such as Drew    |
|Milnes in Neo-Modernism and Avant-Garde Orientations (165).       |
|                                                                     |
|Late Style                                                           |
|The concept of late style can be found in writings by the          |
|twentieth-century German critic and philosopher Theodor W. Adorno,   |
|most notably in a fragment of an essay on Beethoven. It gained       |
|prominence at the beginning of the twenty-first century primarily    |
|thanks to Edward Saids use of it in the posthumously published On   |
|Late Style: Music and Literature Against the Grain (2006). Late     |
|style refers to the distinctive style of the late or last works of  |
|particular artists. It betrays the belief that the work of the last |
|few years of truly great creative artists is marked by a profound  |
|change of style, tone, and content which tends both to look back to  |
|the artists earlier years and forward, beyond his death, to future  |
|developments in the field . . . (McMullan and Smiles 1). The notion |
|of late style is of interest to the debate on late modernism, on |
|the one hand, because modernism can be identified with the style or  |
|styles of art produced in the late phase of modernity. According to  |
|Robert Spencer, this connection between late style and modernity or|
|modernism informs Adornos notion of the concept, while it is largely|
|absent from Saids (221-2, 226). On the other hand, it might be      |
|instructive to think of late modernism as late style of modernism  |
|(Davis Late Modernism 335).                                        |
|                                                                     |
