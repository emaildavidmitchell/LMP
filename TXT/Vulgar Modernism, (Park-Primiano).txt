Vulgar Modernism

Sueyoung Park-Primiano (New York University)

J. Hoberman first introduced his concept of 'vulgar modernism'  in  1981  to
describe a particular sensibility found on the looney  fringes  of  American
popular culturethat is, the 'vulgar equivalent of modernism  itself'.  This
self-conscious and self-reflexive sensibility  was  developed  between  1940
and 1960 in such ironic and subversive works as  Warner  Bros.  cartoons  by
Tex Avery and Chuck Jones, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin comedies directed  by
Frank Tashlin, Mad Magazine's graphic parodies  of  Disney  characters,  and
the television programs by comedian Ernie Kovacs. These  lowbrow  works  are
heavily embedded  with  intertextuality,  forgo  restraint  and  naturalism,
flout conventions and sentimentality, and crack  the  veneer  of  acceptable
materialism and frenzied consumption in  mid-century  American  society.  As
such, these examples of so-called 'para-art' may  be  appreciated  alongside
experimental  or  avant-garde  works  commonly  associated  with  high  art,
including Lettrist poetry and the films of Jean-Luc Godard.
