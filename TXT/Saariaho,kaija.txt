Kaija Saariaho

Mitch Renaud

Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho initially studied in Heleski before moving
on to Freiberg where she studied with Brian Ferneyhough and Klaus Huber
among others. In 1982 she moved to Paris and began to work regularly at the
musical research centre IRCAM. Early in her career she collaborated with
Magnus Lindberg and Esa-Pekka Salonen to form the Finish new music ensemble
Korvat Auki! (Ears Open!).

In the early eighties, her musical language focused on intricate harmonic
structures that slowly transform over the course of the work. Verblendungen
(1982-4) for orchestra and tape is the first work in which she integrated
electronics and live performers. This piece shows her focus on gradual
change over the course of the work as the structure consists of a drawn out
diminuendo from an initial orchestral tutti.

Works of this period fit into the second wave of spectralism, following
Tristan Murail and Grard Grisey, where computers are used in the
composition process to analyze the properties of a sound. This information
is then used as the material for the composition. As Saariahos language
matures the works begin to move further away from the initial plans from
the computer generated material.

Extended playing techniques are utilized, in pieces such as Nympha (1987)
for string quartet and electronics, to create complex sounds that are often
the focal point of a work. Nympha shows the types of electronics common to
her work such as synthetic sounds, modified recorded sounds, and real time
sound processing. Saariahos music after the late eighties tend to be more
expressive, and works such as Chteau de l'me (1996) feature a quicker
rate of change.

Throughout her career Saariaho has had an interest in the human voice, with
players speaking in instrumental works, such as Nympha, as well as vocal
works with or without instruments. Often she plays with the syllabic makeup
of words and sounds found in various languages. From the Grammar of Dreams
(1988), for two sopranos, shows her interest in the relation between
instruments and the human voice as well as the same expansion and control
of traditional playing techniques found with her instrumental writing. The
text is drawn from the poetry of Paul luard.

Throughout the nineties she gradually explored the voice in larger forms
cumulating with the operas L'Amour de loin (2000), Adriana Mater (2006) and
Emilie (2010) all written with the librettist Amin Maalouf.
